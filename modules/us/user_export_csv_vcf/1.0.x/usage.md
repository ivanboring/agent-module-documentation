User Export CSV & VCF lets administrators export selected user accounts as CSV or VCF (vCard) files, driven by Drupal's bulk-operation actions on the People page.
---
On install the module adds Full name (`field_full_name`) and Phone number (`field_phone_number`) fields to user profiles, and provides two bulk actions ("Download User CSV", "Download User VCF") plus download controllers. From `/admin/people` an admin selects users and runs an action to get a single CSV file or a multi-entry VCF; a per-user download link also appears under the operations dropdown. Exported fields include full name, phone, email, address (`field_address`), comment (`field_comment`), and (for VCF) the user picture embedded as base64 JPEG. It relies on the `phone_number`, `address` and `action` contrib modules.

Setup requires no configuration — enable, ensure the added fields are populated, and use the People page. This module has a recorded security finding (see its local `security.md`) concerning the VCF download route's access control; review it before use, since user PII (email/phone) is exported. The VCF download route is defined with `_access: 'TRUE'` while the CSV route uses `access content`.
