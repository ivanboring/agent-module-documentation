User Status Popup turns the user edit form's status field into a primary/danger button (Block or Activate) that opens an AJAX modal confirm form, and exposes a Views field rendering the same action links.

---

Both status-change routes (`/admin/user/{user}/status/block` and `.../active`) require the `administer users` permission and use standard `ConfirmFormBase` forms, so CSRF and access are handled by core. The button and Views field are only rendered for users who already hold `administer users`. Note the confirm forms redirect and build their cancel URL from the raw `Referer` header (`Url::fromUri($request->headers->get('referer'))`) — a benign open-redirect vector, but reachable only by trusted admins. No anonymous surface.
