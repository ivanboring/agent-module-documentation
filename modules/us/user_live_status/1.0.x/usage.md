User Live Status lets each authenticated user set a personal presence status — online, busy, away or offline — shown as a colored indicator in the admin toolbar.
---
The module adds a `user_status` field to users and a toolbar tray (`UserLiveStatusHooks::toolbar`) with links to set each status; the current status renders as a colored dot via the module's CSS library. Choosing a status hits `/admin/user-live-status/{status}` (`UserLiveStatusController::setStatus`, permission `access toolbar`), which updates only the *current* user's own account, invalidates that user's cache tags, and redirects back to the referring page. The status is displayed only in the owner's own toolbar — it does not expose other users' presence.

Setup is zero-config: enable the module and authenticated users get the status control in their toolbar. Note the set-status route is a state-mutating GET with no CSRF token, so a crafted link/image could change the logged-in user's own status (cosmetic only, and limited to their own account — no IDOR). The redirect target is taken from the `Referer` header.
