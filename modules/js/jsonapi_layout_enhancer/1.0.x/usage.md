JSON:API layout enhancer builds on JSON:API and JSON:API Extras to make Layout Builder data easier to consume from a decoupled front end: it inlines custom block (`block_content`) data into serialized layout fields and adds a route that resolves a path alias to its node's JSON:API resource.

---

The `LayoutBlockContentEnhancer` JSON:API field enhancer walks a layout field's components and, for `block_content` provider components, loads the referenced block by UUID and injects its normalized JSON:API representation (via `jsonapi_extras`' EntityToJsonApi) as `block_content_data`. The `GetJsonApiDataFromAliasController` route `/jsonapi/page/{langcode}/{alias}/{alias_2}` (permission `access content`) looks up the alias (or the site front page), finds the target node, and **redirects** to that node's canonical `/jsonapi/node/{bundle}/{uuid}` endpoint (passing through a `resourceVersion` query if present).

Security review: the alias route only issues a redirect — the actual content is served by the standard JSON:API node resource, which enforces its own entity access, so restricted/unpublished nodes are not disclosed by the redirect itself (the target still returns 403/appropriate). The `access content` permission is effectively anonymous, but no privileged data is returned directly. One thing to review on a hardened site: the block_content enhancer normalizes and inlines block data when a layout field is serialized without an explicit extra access check on the block — custom blocks are normally viewable, but if you place access-restricted blocks in layouts, verify that inlined `block_content_data` is acceptable to expose. No confirmed vulnerability.
