# Configuration

Node by Email is configured from a single screen at
**Configuration → System → Node by Email**
(`/admin/config/node_by_email/nodebyemailconfig`). You need the module's
*configure node by email module* permission (an administrator role by default) to
open it. Do not grant that permission to untrusted users — it exposes the mailbox
credentials.

When you save the form, the module tries to connect to your mailbox with the
credentials you entered. On success the top of the page shows *"IMAP connection is
made successfully."*; a warning means the connection failed and no mail will be
ingested until it is fixed.

## The IMAP connection

- **IMAP connection string** — the mailbox string PHP uses to open the connection,
  for example a Gmail-style `{imap.gmail.com:993/imap/ssl}` (keep the braces).
  Substitute your own host for other providers.
- **Email username** — the login for the IMAP account, i.e. the mailbox that
  *receives* the incoming mail.
- **Password** — the IMAP account password. Be aware this is stored in Drupal's
  configuration, so treat the site's config as sensitive and restrict who can
  export or read it. Where your provider offers an app-specific password, prefer
  that over your main account password.

## Which emails become content

- **From email address** — only unread messages whose **`From`** header matches
  this address are picked up. This is the module's *entire* authorization check, and
  as the [overview](../index.md) warns, a `From` header can be forged. Treat this as
  a convenience filter, not a security boundary, and make sure your mail server
  enforces SPF/DKIM/DMARC and the mailbox is locked down.

## Content type settings

- **Content type** — choose which node type(s) the incoming mail should create.
  Remember the type must have a **title** and a **body** field, because the email
  subject fills the title and the email body fills the body.

## Publishing options

- **Author** — the user account set as the author of every node created from email.
  This is independent of who triggers ingestion. **Choose a non‑privileged user**
  here rather than an administrator, so that a spoofed message cannot post content
  under a powerful account.
- **Published / Unpublished** — whether new nodes are published immediately or held
  as unpublished drafts. **Keep this unpublished** unless you fully trust the mail
  path, so a human can review each item before it goes live. Also set a **safe text
  format** on the body field to avoid stored‑XSS from HTML email.
- **Cron interval (seconds)** — the minimum number of seconds between automatic
  ingestion runs on Drupal cron. A smaller number checks the mailbox more often; a
  larger number is gentler on the mail server.

## Creating nodes from the unseen-mail list

Besides cron, the module offers an admin page that lists the mailbox's unseen
messages (subject, body, date). You can select messages and create nodes from them
in a batch — useful for reviewing before publishing. That page is gated by its own
permission, so grant it only to trusted editors. After a message is processed it is
marked as seen so it is not picked up again.

## Save

Click **Save configuration**. Watch for the *"IMAP connection is made
successfully."* confirmation, then send a test email from your configured sender
address and either wait for cron or use the unseen-mail list to confirm a node is
created as expected.
