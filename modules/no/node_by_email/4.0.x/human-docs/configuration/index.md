# Configuration

Node by Email is configured from a single screen at
**Configuration → System → Node by Email**
(`/admin/config/node_by_email/nodebyemailconfig`). Saving the form makes the module
attempt an IMAP connection with the credentials you entered: on success the top of
the page reads *"IMAP connection is made successfully."*, and a warning means the
connection failed and nothing will be ingested until it is fixed.

## Permissions

Two admin-level permissions gate the module's pages. Grant them only to trusted
roles — neither should go to untrusted users.

| Permission | Controls |
|------------|----------|
| **configure node by email module** | The configuration screen above, which holds the IMAP credentials, sender, author, publish state, and cron interval. |
| **access to unseen mail list** | The **Unseen Emails** page (`/admin/config/node_by_email/unseenEmailList`) that lists unread mail and creates nodes from selected messages via a batch. |

## The IMAP connection

- **IMAP connection string** — the mailbox string PHP uses to open the connection.
  The shipped default is a Gmail-style `{imap.gmail.com:993/imap/ssl}` (keep the
  braces). For other providers substitute the host, e.g.
  `{imap.mail.yahoo.com:993/imap/ssl}` or `{imap.aol.com:993/imap/ssl}`.
- **Email username** — the login for the IMAP account, i.e. the mailbox that
  *receives* the mail.
- **Password** — the IMAP account password. **This is stored in plain text** in the
  site's configuration, so treat exported config as sensitive and restrict who can
  read it. Where your provider offers an app-specific password, use that rather than
  your main account password.

## Which emails become content

- **From email address** — only unread messages whose **`From`** header matches this
  address are ingested (the module runs an IMAP search for `FROM "<address>" UNSEEN`).
  This is the module's *entire* authorization check, and a `From` header can be
  forged, so treat it as a convenience filter and rely on your mail server's
  SPF/DKIM/DMARC enforcement for real protection.

## Content type settings

- **Content type(s)** — tick which node type(s) incoming mail should create. The
  type must have a **title** and a **body** field, since the subject fills the title
  and the email body fills the body.

## Publishing options

- **Author** — the user account set as the author of every node created from email,
  regardless of who or what triggered ingestion (cron, Drush, or the form). The
  shipped default is **user 1 (the superuser)** — **change this to a non‑privileged
  user** so a spoofed message can never post under a powerful account.
- **Published / Unpublished** — whether new nodes are published immediately or held
  as drafts. The shipped default is **unpublished** (`0`); keep it that way unless
  you fully trust the mail path, so a human reviews each item first. Set a **safe
  text format** on the body field as well, to avoid stored‑XSS from HTML email.
- **Cron interval (seconds)** — the minimum number of seconds between automatic
  ingestion runs on Drupal cron (the shipped default is `3600`, i.e. hourly). Lower
  it to check the mailbox more often, raise it to be gentler on the mail server.

## Save

Click **Save configuration** and watch for *"IMAP connection is made
successfully."* Then send a test email from your configured sender address and
either wait for cron, run `drush nbe-gn`, or use the **Unseen Emails** page to
confirm a node is created as expected. After a message is processed it is marked
seen and flagged so it will not be ingested again.
