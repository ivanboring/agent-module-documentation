Nodeletter turns a content node into a newsletter and sends it through Mailchimp, tracking each send as a `nodeletter_sending` entity.
---
Editors often want to push a published node (a press release, an announcement) to a mailing list without leaving Drupal. Nodeletter adds a per-node "Newsletter" tab that renders a sending form: pick recipient selectors within a configured Mailchimp list, send a test mail, or trigger the real send (real sending is globally gated by the `nodeletter_allow_sending` setting). Each node type is configured (`/admin/structure/types/manage/{type}/nodeletter`) with a Mailchimp list, a template, and template-variable field mappings; a pluggable `NodeletterSender` architecture (currently a Mailchimp implementation) does the actual API work via `mailchimp.api`.

Access to the per-node form is gated by `_entity_access: node.update` plus custom checks that the content type has Nodeletter enabled (`_nodeletter_enabled`) and the node is published (`_node_published`). Admin settings and per-type settings require `administer site configuration`; the sendings collection uses a `view nodeletter_sending entity` permission and the sending entity uses its own access control handler. The optional `nodeletter_blocks` submodule exposes the sending form as a block — note that the underlying `NewsletterSubmitForm` (a plain `FormBase`) has no intrinsic access check and relies on the route/block placement to gate it, so a block placed on a public page would expose the test-mail send (arbitrary recipient) and, if enabled, real sending.

Setup: enable the module, configure Mailchimp credentials in the mailchimp module, enable Nodeletter per node type and map the list/template/variables, then use the per-node Newsletter tab.
