Notebook is a small admin tool for keeping notes (subject, body and an optional 10-digit phone number) in a dedicated `notebook_table` database table.
---
It exposes a set of routes under paths like `notebook/page`, `add/notes`, `notes/desplay`, `see/note`, `edit/note`, `edit/note_page` and `remove/note`. The main page combines an add-note form with a paged (4 per page) list of saved notes; each row links to a view page and a JavaScript-driven remove link. Notes can be viewed, edited and deleted. All create/read/update/delete goes through the Drupal database API with parameterised conditions, and the phone field is validated to ten digits.

Every route requires the `administer notebook` permission, so the notebook is not exposed to anonymous users. There is no per-user ownership column, so it is a single shared notebook for everyone holding that permission rather than private per-user notes. Two operational cautions for agents: several handlers read identifiers straight from `$_REQUEST`/`$_GET` (e.g. `show_id`, `edit_id`, `id`), and the delete route removes a record from a plain GET request with no CSRF token — meaning a delete link can be triggered cross-site against a logged-in administrator. Setup is just enabling the module and granting the permission; there is no settings form.
