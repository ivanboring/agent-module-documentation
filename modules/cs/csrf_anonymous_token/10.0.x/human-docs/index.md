# Anonymous CSRF token — manual setup guide

**Anonymous CSRF token** (`csrf_anonymous_token`) is a very small module that
tries to bring CSRF‑style token protection to forms submitted by **anonymous**
users. Drupal core adds its form build token (`#token`) only for authenticated
users; this module targets the gap by adding a hidden token element to forms that
don't already carry one. It ships as just an `.info.yml` and a `.module` file,
has no settings, and works globally on every tokenless form once enabled.

Concretely, it uses `hook_form_alter` so that any form without a core `#token`
gets an extra `anon_token` element (and it stashes the current session id in the
session). The intent is to add a per‑session token to anonymous forms such as
login, register, contact, and search.

It is important to be honest about what this module actually does, because its
public documentation flags real caveats. The added validator **never calls
Drupal's `csrfToken()->validate()`**, so it does not truly verify the submitted
token against the session — and its internal check can even raise a validation
error on otherwise‑valid submissions. In practice it does not strengthen real
CSRF protection and can **break legitimate anonymous form submissions**. Treat it
as experimental / security‑theater rather than a hardening measure. The project is
also **not covered** by Drupal's security advisory policy.

Given all that, most sites are better served by Drupal core's built‑in
protections and by dedicated, well‑maintained anti‑CSRF or anti‑spam modules. If
you do install this, **test thoroughly** — especially with the internal page
cache active for anonymous users — before using it in production. There is no data
disclosure or privilege‑escalation surface here; the practical risk is broken
forms and a false sense of protection. Uninstalling it removes all of its altered
behavior immediately.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install the module with Composer and
   enable it.

There is **no configuration page**, no permissions, and no routes. The module's
behavior is global the moment it is enabled — you cannot scope it to specific
forms through the UI. To limit or undo its effect on a given form you would have
to alter or unset the added element in a custom module.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

Anonymous CSRF token adds no admin page. It works invisibly by altering form
builds site‑wide.
