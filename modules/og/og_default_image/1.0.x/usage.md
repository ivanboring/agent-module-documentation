OG Default Image sets a fallback `og:image` for Metatag, so a page shared on social media without its own image gets the site's default rather than nothing.

---

When a link is posted to LinkedIn, Facebook, Slack or WhatsApp, the platform reads `og:image` and renders a card. With no image the card is a bare line of text that attracts a fraction of the attention, and the pages most likely to lack one are exactly the pages most likely to be shared quickly — a news item, a landing page, an announcement written in a hurry. Metatag handles the tags themselves but takes the image from a field, so a node with an empty image field produces no tag. This module supplies the site-wide fallback, an image field configured at `/admin/config/search/metatag/og-default-image` behind Metatag's own `administer metatags` permission — the right choice, since it keeps one permission governing all metatag configuration rather than inventing a second. Version **1.0.1**, depending on `metatag`, core `^9 || ^10 || ^11`. Note the name collision worth avoiding: `og` in Drupal usually means **Organic Groups**, and here it means **Open Graph**. Two practical points: the platforms have **dimension expectations** — around 1200×630, with a minimum below which the card renders small or not at all — so the default should be sized for that rather than being whatever was to hand; and social platforms **cache aggressively**, so a page scraped once with no image keeps its bare card until the platform is asked to re-scrape, meaning the fallback fixes future shares rather than past ones.
