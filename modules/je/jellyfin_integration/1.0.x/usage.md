Jellyfin Integration connects a Drupal site to a Jellyfin media server through a reusable client service and an admin-only browsing UI.

---

`JellyfinClient` (`jellyfin_integration.client`, injected with `http_client`, `config.factory`, `logger.factory`) wraps the Jellyfin REST API: system info, users, virtual folders / media folders, items with filters, latest/resume/similar items, search hints, genres, studios, artists, persons, playback info, and image/poster/backdrop/stream URL builders. Every authenticated request adds an `Authorization: MediaBrowser Token="<api_key>"` header. The server URL and API key are stored in `jellyfin_integration.settings` and edited at `/admin/config/media/jellyfin` via `JellyfinSettingsForm` (which offers a test-connection button). `JellyfinLibraryController` renders admin pages to browse libraries, movies, TV shows, per-library items, and item details with artwork.

All six routes require `administer site configuration`, so the browsing UI and settings are admin-only; there are no anonymous or mutating public endpoints. Security notes for operators: the API key is stored in plain module config (not a Key entity) and is embedded in constructed stream URLs as an `api_key` query parameter (`JellyfinClient.php:562`); the server URL comes from trusted admin config (not request input), so there is no user-driven SSRF. The controller builds some markup with `sprintf()` from remote Jellyfin field values (item name/year/image URL) into `#markup` without escaping (`JellyfinLibraryController.php:388-396`, backdrop style at `:253`) — only reachable by administrators, but a compromised/malicious Jellyfin server could inject HTML into those admin pages. TLS verification is left at Guzzle defaults (enabled); no `verify => false`.
