Unomi Integration links a Drupal site to an Apache Unomi customer-data platform (self-hosted or a hosted service such as Dropsolid), so visitor profiles and segments computed by Unomi can drive personalization in Drupal.

---

Connectivity is handled by a pluggable `UnomiConnector` plugin type: the shipped `BasicAuthUnomiConnector` talks to the Unomi REST API via `@http_client` using an admin-configured server URI plus HTTP basic-auth username/password. `UnomiClientBase`/`UnomiClientBasicAuth` wrap the API calls and cache responses in a dedicated `cache.unomi` bin; `UnomiCookieManager` reads/writes the Unomi profile cookie from the request. A `SegmentSelection` condition plugin lets other modules/blocks show or hide content based on the visitor's Unomi segments. All settings live at `/admin/config/services/unomi` behind the `administer unomi` permission.

Security review: the Unomi server URI is admin-configured (not request-supplied), so there is no SSRF surface, and TLS is left at Guzzle defaults (no `verify => false` anywhere in the module). Credentials are stored in module config; the connector re-uses the existing saved password when the form is submitted without a new one. Setup: stand up or obtain a Unomi endpoint, add a connector with its URL + basic-auth credentials at the settings form, then use the segment condition where personalization is needed.
