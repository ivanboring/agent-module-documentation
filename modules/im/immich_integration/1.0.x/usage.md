Immich Integration provides a comprehensive `ImmichClient` service (and a small admin UI) for talking to a self-hosted Immich photo/video management server's REST API.
---
The `immich_integration.client` service wraps Guzzle to call the Immich API using a configured server URL and API key (sent as the `x-api-key` header), covering server info/health, albums (CRUD + asset add/remove), assets (list/get/update/delete/statistics, thumbnail & original URLs), search, timeline buckets, people/face recognition, shared links, tags, users, libraries, and memories. All methods return `NULL` on failure and log errors. An admin settings form at `/admin/config/media/immich` (permission `administer site configuration`) stores the server URL + API key and offers an AJAX "Test Connection". Additional admin routes list and view albums; every route requires `administer site configuration` and is an `_admin_route`.

Security notes for operators: requests use Drupal's default Guzzle `http_client`, so TLS certificate verification is **on** (no `verify => false`), and the server URL is admin-configured, so there is no untrusted-input SSRF. However, the **API key is stored in plaintext module config** (`api_key` textfield → `immich_integration.settings`) rather than via the Key module — treat the config export as a secret. The connection-test AJAX callback also echoes the Immich server's version string into `#markup` without escaping (`ImmichSettingsForm::testConnectionAjax`); it is admin-only and reflects the trusted server's response, so risk is low. The module is a foundation/service layer — it renders galleries only through its own admin album pages; building front-end display is left to integrators.

Typical setup: enable the module, go to `/admin/config/media/immich`, enter the Immich server URL and an API key generated in Immich, test the connection, and save; then inject `immich_integration.client` into custom code.
