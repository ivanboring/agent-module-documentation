Aggregates status summaries from multiple Drupal sites (via HMAC-signed requests to their Multisite Status Report endpoints) onto one admin dashboard.

---

Multisite Status Dashboard pulls the status summary from several remote Drupal sites — each running the companion Multisite Status Report module — and shows them together on one admin dashboard at `/admin/reports/multisite-status`.

Each remote site is a `monitored_site` config entity (label, base URL, key ID, shared secret, enabled) managed at `/admin/config/services/multisite-status-dashboard/sites` under the restricted `administer multisite status dashboard` permission. `StatusFetcher` requests `<base_url>/multisite-status-report/summary` with HMAC-SHA256 signed headers (`X-MSR-Key`, `X-MSR-Timestamp`, `X-MSR-Nonce`, `X-MSR-Signature`) — the shared secret is used only to compute the signature locally and is never sent over the wire; the outbound HTTP client uses default TLS verification. Results are stored via `StatusAggregator` (keyvalue) and can be refreshed either through a queue worker (`SiteStatusFetchWorker`) on cron or on demand via `POST /admin/reports/multisite-status/refresh` (CSRF-protected). The dashboard renders severity, reachability and summary per site; it does not display the stored secrets. Viewing the dashboard needs `view multisite status dashboard`.

Note: the shared HMAC secret is stored in the `monitored_site` config entity's exportable `secret` property (plaintext in exported config), rather than via the Key module — an operational consideration for config-in-VCS, but access to that config requires the restricted admin permission. Typical setup: add each monitored site with its key ID and secret, then view or refresh the aggregated dashboard.
