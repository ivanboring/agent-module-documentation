# Stripe API — manual setup guide

**Stripe API** (`stripe_api`) wires the official Stripe PHP library into Drupal.
It does not, by itself, take a payment or add a checkout button — it is
infrastructure that other modules build on. It gives you three things: secure
storage for your Stripe API keys (through the Key module), a ready-to-use Stripe
client service (`@stripe_api.stripe_api`) that a developer can inject into any
custom class, and a webhook endpoint at `/stripe/webhook` that validates incoming
Stripe events and re-broadcasts them as Drupal events your code can subscribe to.

The problem it solves is duplication and risk: rather than every subscription,
donation, or commerce integration inventing its own authenticated Stripe client
and its own webhook verification, they can all share one correctly-built
foundation. And the webhook handling here is worth singling out as a reference
implementation. The `/stripe/webhook` route accepts POST requests only, and its
real security is not a permission but a cryptographic signature check: it calls
the official SDK's `Webhook::constructEvent()`, which verifies Stripe's HMAC
signature against your endpoint's signing secret, enforces a timestamp tolerance,
and uses a constant-time comparison. An event with a bad signature is rejected
with a 403 and nothing is dispatched. A transient processing failure returns a
503 with a `Retry-After` header so Stripe retries later instead of assuming the
event was delivered — the detail most home-grown integrations get wrong.

Stripe API **requires the Key module** as a hard dependency, which is deliberate:
your Stripe secret key lives in a Key entity backed by an environment variable,
so it never ends up in exported configuration or version control. Two things are
worth knowing. First, on an invalid signature the handler logs the full request
body; the value is escaped, but because anyone can reach the endpoint it is a
potential log-flooding surface. Second, the safety of the events it dispatches
depends on their subscribers — a subscriber that acts on an event's contents
without re-fetching the object from Stripe is trusting a payload, and re-fetching
is the standard advice for anything that moves money.

This guide is written for a **human** setting the module up. If you are an AI
coding agent, read the sibling [`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer, set up the Key
   module, and enable Stripe API.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — enter your keys, choose test vs.
   live mode, and set up the webhook.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

Its settings form is the route `stripe_api.admin`, reached at
**Configuration → Web services → Stripe API**
(`/admin/config/services/stripe_api`), and access is gated by the
**Administer Stripe API** (`administer stripe api`) permission.
