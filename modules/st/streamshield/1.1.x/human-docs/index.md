# Streamshield — manual setup guide

**Streamshield** (`streamshield`) adds automated, AI-driven content moderation to
your Drupal site by connecting it to the
[Streamshield](https://www.streamshield.ai) moderation service. When users create
nodes or comments of the content types you choose, the module sends their content
to Streamshield, whose machine-learning models scan text (and, per the service,
images, video, and audio) and can decide to flag it. If Streamshield flags a piece
of content, it calls back to your site and the module **unpublishes** it
automatically — keeping offensive material out of public view without a human in
the loop.

Setting it up is a short sequence: register your site with Streamshield to obtain a
domain access key and secret, choose which content types should be moderated, and
optionally run a scan to re-process existing content. From then on, moderation
happens automatically as content is created or updated. The module has no
dependencies beyond Drupal core and supports Drupal 10 and 11.

**Please review the security posture before you deploy this publicly.** Streamshield
exposes two front-facing endpoints so the external service can talk back to your
site: a **callback** endpoint (`POST /streamshield/callback`) that unpublishes the
node or comment named in a decision, and a **file** endpoint
(`GET /streamshield/file`) that returns file bytes for a requested path. Both are
declared as publicly reachable (`_access: TRUE`) and depend entirely on the module's
own HMAC-style signature/access-key check to authenticate requests — so the safety
of those endpoints rests wholly on that signature check being correct. The module
also configures its outbound HTTP client in a way that weakens transport (TLS)
security. These are **already-recorded findings in the module's own security
notes** — operators should read that material and satisfy themselves about the risk
before exposing the endpoints on a public site. Keep the access and secret keys
stored as secrets.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token-cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer and enable the
   module.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — register the site, choose content
   types, and scan existing content.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

The module's admin pages sit under **Configuration → Streamshield**
(`/admin/config/streamshield`), with sub-pages for **Registration**, **Content
Types**, and **Scan**. All of the admin pages are gated by the **Administer site
configuration** permission.
