Streamshield sends user-generated content (selected node and comment types) to the Streamshield AI moderation service and lets that service call back to unpublish content it flags.

---

After registering the site (`/admin/config/streamshield/registration`) and choosing which content types to moderate (`/admin/config/streamshield/content_types`), the `ModerationService` gathers moderatable fields from a node/comment, attaches signed metadata, and POSTs them to the Streamshield API via Guzzle; a `scan` form re-processes existing content. Two front-facing endpoints support the service: `streamshield.callback` (`POST /streamshield/callback`) receives a decision and, for `action=unpublish`, loads the referenced node/comment by id and unpublishes it; `streamshield.image` (`GET /streamshield/file`) returns file bytes for a requested path. Both are declared with `_access: 'TRUE'` and instead rely on an HMAC-style `HashService` signature/`access_key` check to authenticate requests. Admin config routes are gated by `administer site configuration`.

This module has separately recorded security findings (see the module's `security.md`); operators should review it before deploying publicly. In brief, the two `_access: TRUE` endpoints depend entirely on the correctness of the signature check for their safety, and the registration/moderation HTTP client is configured in a way that weakens transport security. Typical setup: register the site to obtain access/secret keys, select content types, and let content be moderated automatically on create/update.
