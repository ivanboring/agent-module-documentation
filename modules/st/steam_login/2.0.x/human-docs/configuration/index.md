# Configuration

Steam Login has no settings form of its own — you configure it through three
existing places in Drupal: the Steam API module's settings, the account
registration settings, and the block layout.

> **Security caveat (repeated for good reason):** the OpenID callback in this
> version does not verify Steam's response and allows an anonymous attacker to log
> in as any Steam-linked account (see the [main guide](../index.md)). Complete the
> setup below only for testing or evaluation; do not depend on it to protect real
> accounts until the verification flaw is fixed.

## 1. Set the Steam API key

Steam Login uses the **Steam API** module to look up the player's display name on
login, so you must configure the key there:

- Go to `/admin/config/services/steam_api` and enter your Steam Web API key.

## 2. Allow visitors to register, without email verification

Steam logins carry no email address, so Drupal's normal registration flow has to
be relaxed:

1. Go to **Configuration → People → Account settings**
   (`/admin/config/people/accounts`).
2. Under **Who can register accounts?** choose **Visitors**.
3. **Uncheck** *Require email verification when a visitor creates an account*
   (there is no email to verify).
4. Save.

Without this, the module cannot create accounts for first-time Steam visitors.

## 3. Place the Steam OpenId block

1. Go to **Structure → Block layout** (`/admin/structure/block`).
2. Add the **Steam OpenId** block (`steam_openid`) to a region.
3. In the block's configuration, choose which of the two official Steam sign-in
   button images to display.

For authenticated users, the block shows a logout link and an account link instead
of the sign-in button.

## How login works

- An anonymous visitor clicks the Steam button, hitting `/steam-auth`.
- The controller redirects them to Steam's OpenID login
  (`https://steamcommunity.com/openid/login`), with a return URL back to
  `/steam-auth`.
- Steam returns the visitor to `/steam-auth`. The module reads the Steam64 ID from
  the returned identity, looks up an existing user by `field_steam64id`, creates a
  `steam-<id>` account if none exists, and logs the user in — then sends them to
  their profile.

**The weak point is exactly this return step:** the module trusts the returned
identity after a format check only, with no cryptographic verification against
Steam. That is what makes the callback forgeable. Keep this in mind before
enabling the login on any site with accounts worth protecting.
