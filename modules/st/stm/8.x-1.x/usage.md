**Simple Taxonomy Menu (STM)** adds a *Sync To Menu* tab to a vocabulary's term-overview page that builds menu links mirroring that vocabulary's term tree — a quick way to turn a category taxonomy into a navigation menu without hand-creating each link.

---

The module registers one route, `stm.taxonomy_vocabulary.sync_menu_form` (`/admin/structure/taxonomy/manage/{taxonomy_vocabulary}/overview/menu`, local task *Sync To Menu*), backed by the form `SyncToMenuForm`. Access is controlled by the route requirement `_entity_access: 'taxonomy_vocabulary.view'`. The form loads the vocabulary's terms (via the `taxonomy_term` storage) and, on submit, creates menu-link content entities that reproduce the term parent/child hierarchy into a chosen menu. It has no services, permissions, config entities or blocks of its own and stores nothing beyond the menu links it generates. **Access note:** gating a menu-*generating* action behind the vocabulary `view` operation is comparatively loose for a mutation; on sites where non-privileged roles can view vocabularies this lets them create menu links. Forms carry Drupal's built-in CSRF token, and menu-link creation is low-impact, so this is a hardening observation rather than a confirmed anonymous vulnerability. Legacy machine version `8.x-1.2`.
