# Simple Taxonomy Menu — manual setup guide

**Simple Taxonomy Menu** (`stm`) is a time-saver for turning a taxonomy vocabulary
into a navigation menu. It adds a **Sync To Menu** tab to a vocabulary's term
overview page; from there you pick a menu, and the module generates menu links
that mirror the vocabulary's term hierarchy — parent terms become parent links,
child terms become child links — so you do not have to hand-create a menu link for
every term.

It covers similar ground to the older Taxonomy Menu module but with a simpler
approach and a couple of useful extras: it uses core's menu-link-content entities,
respects term weight so ordering and hierarchy carry over, and lets you set a
custom path pattern (so links can point at `/category/%tid` or `/vocabulary/%tid/all`
instead of the default `/taxonomy/term/%tid`).

The module works on demand — there is no settings page and nothing to configure
after enabling it. Each time you want to (re)build a menu from a vocabulary, you
open that vocabulary's Sync To Menu tab and click **Sync**. It has no dependencies
beyond Drupal core and supports Drupal 9 and 10.

One access detail is worth knowing: the Sync To Menu form is gated by the
vocabulary **view** permission rather than a stricter administrative one. Because
generating menu links is a change to the site, this is a comparatively loose gate
for a mutation — on a site where non-privileged roles can view vocabularies, they
could in principle trigger a sync. The impact is low (it only creates menu links,
and the form carries Drupal's CSRF token), but it is worth keeping in mind when you
decide who can reach vocabulary pages.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token-cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer and enable the
   module.

## How to use it

1. Make sure you have a taxonomy vocabulary (for example *Category*) with some
   terms in it.
2. Navigate to that vocabulary's term overview and open the **Sync To Menu** tab —
   the URL is `/admin/structure/taxonomy/manage/{vocabulary}/overview/menu`
   (e.g. `/admin/structure/taxonomy/manage/category/overview/menu`).
3. Choose the **menu** the terms should be synced into — *Main navigation*, for
   example.
4. Set the **path pattern** if you want something other than the default
   `/taxonomy/term/%tid` — such as `/category/%tid`.
5. Click **Sync**. The module creates menu links mirroring the term hierarchy. Run
   it again after adding terms to refresh the menu.
