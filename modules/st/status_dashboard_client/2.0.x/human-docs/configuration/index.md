# Configuration

Configuring this module is mostly one thing: **set a shared secret**, and then
register the same secret (and this site's URL) in the central Status Dashboard
site.

## Set the shared secret (do this first)

1. Log in as a user with the **Administer status_dashboard_client configuration**
   permission.
2. Go to **Configuration → Development → Status dashboard client**
   (`/admin/config/development/status-dashboard-client`).
3. Enter a long, random string in the **Secret** field and save. This value is
   stored in `status_dashboard_client.settings:secret`.

Or set it from the command line:

```bash
drush config:set status_dashboard_client.settings secret 'SOME-LONG-RANDOM-STRING' -y
```

> **Why this is urgent.** The endpoint's access check compares the secret in the
> incoming request header against the stored secret. When the stored secret is
> **empty** (the shipped default), a request that sends **no** secret header makes
> that comparison "empty equals empty" and passes — so before you set a secret, the
> full report (including the list of installed modules that have known, unpatched
> security releases) is readable by anyone who hits the endpoint. Setting a strong
> secret closes that immediately. You can rotate the secret at any time by editing
> this one field.

## The reporting endpoint

The module adds one endpoint:

- **URL:** `/status_dashboard/check` (route `status_dashboard_client.check`),
  `GET` only, and never cached.
- **Access:** the caller must send an HTTP header
  **`x-dashboard-secret: <your secret>`** matching the value you saved. There's no
  permission or CSRF on this route — the secret is the only gate.

On a matching request the module runs core's Update Manager and returns a JSON
document with these keys:

| Key | What it contains |
|-----|------------------|
| `date` | The current timestamp. |
| `core` | The Drupal core version. |
| `modules` | A map of module display name → version, for every extension in the list. |
| `security_updates` | Projects with pending **security** updates → recommended version. |
| `feature_updates` | Projects with a newer recommended (non-security) release → recommended version. |
| `sitename` | The site name. |
| `url` | The site's scheme and host. |
| `error_count` | The number of status-report requirement **errors** (severity above warning). |

## Connect the central dashboard

On your separate **Status Dashboard** monitoring site, register this client with
its base URL and the **same secret** you set above. The dashboard then polls
`/status_dashboard/check` on a schedule, aggregating each client's update and
security status and — if you've configured it there — emailing daily/weekly/monthly
notifications. Reporting is pull-based: the dashboard fetches from each client; the
client never pushes.

## Extending the payload (optional, for developers)

Modules can add to or adjust the JSON before it's returned, via
`hook_status_dashboard_json_response_alter(&$json_response, $projects_data)` — for
example to append the PHP version or the last cron run time. Keys you add appear
verbatim in the JSON, so keep them JSON-serializable. See the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/hooks/alter.md) docs for an example.
