**Star Rating** adds an Amazon-style 1-5 star rating widget to content. Visitors click a star (and optionally leave a comment); the vote is saved via AJAX and can be mirrored into a configured [Webform](https://www.drupal.org/project/webform) submission. Blocks and an extra field render the average score, a rating distribution summary, and per-node averages.

---

The widget theme `star_rating` (template `star-rating.html.twig`) posts to route `star_rating.save` (`/star-rating/save`, controller `RatingController::save`). The controller reads `entity_type` (actually the bundle), `entity_id`, `rating` and `comment` from the POST body and `INSERT`s a row into the custom `star_rating` table (`uid`, rating, comment, created) using the query builder (parameterized — no SQL injection); if a Webform is configured it also creates a `WebformSubmission` mapping the configured rating/comment/entity-id elements. Aggregation is done by three blocks — `StarRatingBlock` (the input widget), `StarRatingAverageBlock`, `StarRatingSummaryBlock` (5→1 star distribution percentages) — and a `StarRatingAverageExtraField` display, all reading from the configured Webform's submissions (`webform_id`, `rating_element`, `comment_element`, `entity_id_element` set at `star_rating.settings`, `/admin/config/content/star-rating`, permission *administer site configuration*). `hook_webform_submission_insert/update` invalidate the relevant `node:<nid>` cache tag. **Security note (reported separately):** `star_rating.save` is gated only by the `access content` permission (granted to anonymous by default), performs an unauthenticated write with no CSRF token, and its duplicate-vote guard is commented out — so anonymous users can insert unlimited ratings/comments (rating spam / DB growth). The stored `comment` is not rendered by any of the shipped blocks/templates, so there is no stored-XSS sink in this module.
