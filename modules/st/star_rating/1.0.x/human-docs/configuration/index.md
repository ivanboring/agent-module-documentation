# Configuration

Star Rating's settings form is where you connect the rating widget to a
[Webform](https://www.drupal.org/project/webform) so that votes are mirrored into
Webform submissions and the average/summary blocks have data to read.

## Open the settings form

1. Log in as a user with the **Administer site configuration** permission (an
   administrator by default).
2. Go to **Configuration → Content authoring → Star Rating**, or navigate directly
   to `/admin/config/content/star-rating`.

The settings are stored in the `star_rating.settings` configuration.

## The fields

The form maps the widget's data onto a Webform and its elements. You choose the
Webform, then tell the module which of that Webform's elements should receive each
piece of a rating submission:

- **Webform** (`webform_id`) — the Webform that ratings are written into. Each
  time a visitor rates something, the module creates a submission in this form. It
  is also the source the average and distribution-summary blocks read from, so
  pick (or first create) a Webform with fields for a rating value, a comment, and
  the id of the rated entity.
- **Rating element** (`rating_element`) — the machine name of the Webform element
  that stores the 1–5 star value.
- **Comment element** (`comment_element`) — the machine name of the Webform
  element that stores the optional free-text comment left with a rating.
- **Entity id element** (`entity_id_element`) — the machine name of the Webform
  element that records which node/entity the rating belongs to, so ratings can be
  aggregated per piece of content.

## Save

Click **Save configuration**. From then on, each rating submitted through the
widget is written both to the module's own `star_rating` table and to the
configured Webform, and the average and summary blocks compute their figures from
those Webform submissions. When a node has no ratings yet, the summary displays a
"No reviews yet" message.

## A note on ratings and abuse

Remember that the save endpoint is reachable by anonymous visitors, is not
protected by a CSRF token, and ships with its duplicate-vote guard disabled (see
the [main guide](../index.md)). Configuring the Webform does not change that. If
the widget will be exposed to the public, add your own flood control or require
authentication so the linked Webform is not filled with spam submissions.
