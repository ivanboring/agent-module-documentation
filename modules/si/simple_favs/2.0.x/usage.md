Simple favourites gives site visitors a lightweight way to bookmark content, storing favourites in a browser cookie for anonymous users and (optionally) in the database for logged-in users.

---

The module provides heart/favourite blocks, a Views field, a "My favourites" management page at `/my-favourites`, and a set of JSON endpoints for reading and writing favourites. A settings form at `/admin/config/simple_favs/settings` (permission `administer simple favs`) toggles database storage and display limits. Favourites are keyed by the current user server-side: the database controllers (`SimpleFavsStorageController`, `SimpleFavsStorageOtherController`, `SimpleFavsManageController`) all derive the uid from `currentUser()` — never from the request — reject anonymous writes (uid 0), and store node ids in `simple_favs_user` and arbitrary path/title favourites in `simple_favs_user_other`. A public titles endpoint (`/simple-favs/titles`, `_access: 'TRUE'`) only returns titles of published nodes and runs an access-checked entity query.

Security review: there is **no IDOR** — because every read/write scopes to the authenticated uid and the `_access: 'TRUE'` endpoint exposes only published, access-checked node titles, a user cannot read or modify another user's favourites or arbitrary entities. The mutating endpoints (`/simple-favs/set-user-favs`, `/set-user-favs-other`, `/save-titles`) are gated by `access content` and reject anonymous users, but they read the JSON body **without a CSRF token**, so a cross-site request could cause a logged-in user to overwrite their *own* favourites list (low impact, self-scoped only). Stored favourites are read back with `unserialize()` (e.g. SimpleFavsStorageController.php:45); the values are module-written `serialize()` of JSON-decoded arrays (no objects), so object injection is not practically reachable, but adding `['allowed_classes' => FALSE]` would harden it. Typical setup is enabling the module, placing a heart block, and optionally turning on database storage for authenticated users.
