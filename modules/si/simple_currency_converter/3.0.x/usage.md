Runs client-side against a CSS selector of prices on the page and converts them from a base currency into the currency the visitor picks, using pluggable server-side exchange-rate feeds.

---

The module attaches a currency picker (a jQuery UI dialog) and JS that finds price elements matching a configured `conversion_selector`, then rewrites them for the chosen currency. Conversion ratios are fetched from the `/simple_currency_converter_set_currency/{from_currency}/{to_currency}` endpoint, which asks the `simple_currency_converter.default` service for a rate and returns it as JSON, caching it (in the cache backend or a cookie per `default_storage`). Rates come from pluggable feed services chosen in config as `feed_primary`/`feed_secondary`; the bundled submodules provide the European Central Bank feed (`ecb_scc`) and the FloatRates feed (`floatrates_scc`), and `notifier_scc` emails an admin when a conversion check fails. Feeds are collected via a compiler pass, so developers can register their own `CurrencyConverterInterface` service.

Operationally, admin config lives at `/admin/config/regional/simplecurrencyconverter` (permission `administer simple currency converter`), where you set the price selector, dialog labels, default currency, rate lifetime, and storage. The rate endpoint is intentionally `_access: 'TRUE'` so anonymous visitors can switch currency; it does **not** fetch any request-supplied URL — feed URLs are fixed from config/hardcoded and the path's currency codes are used only as array keys against the parsed feed, so there is no SSRF, and the response is `application/json` (no HTML reflection). Note the ECB feed URL is plain `http://` (cleartext).

Typical setup: enable the module and at least one feed submodule, choose the feed under the admin form, set the CSS selector matching your rendered prices, pick a default/base currency and cache lifetime, and place/enable the picker.
