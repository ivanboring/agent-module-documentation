# Signature (sign_widget) — manual setup guide

**Signature** (`sign_widget`) lets a person draw a signature in the browser on
an HTML5 canvas and stores the result as a file. It works in two places: as a
widget on a core **image** field (the drawing is saved as a PNG and attached to
the entity) and as a **CKEditor 5** button (the drawing is saved as an SVG in
the editor's inline-images folder). Its display name in the admin list is simply
"Signature", but its machine name — the name you use in Drush and Composer — is
`sign_widget`. Do not confuse it with the separate `signature` module, which is
a text signature for user profiles.

The module depends only on core's **Image** module. On Drupal 8 through 12 it
loads the underlying signature-pad JavaScript from a CDN, so there is no library
to download by hand. There are no submodules and no central settings form —
everything is configured per-field in an entity's *Manage form display* (and, for
the editor button, in *Text formats and editors*).

**Important safety warning — please read before using this module.** The module's
own documentation records that both of its AJAX endpoints are effectively open to
anonymous visitors on a standard site, and both were confirmed working anonymously
on a clean install. One endpoint takes the entity type, entity id and field name
straight from the request body and saves the uploaded file to that entity with no
access check at all — meaning an anonymous caller can modify and save arbitrary
content, including the administrator account. The other writes a caller-supplied
SVG verbatim into the public files directory, which was shown to store and serve
an SVG containing a script (a same-origin stored cross-site-scripting problem).
Neither endpoint uses a CSRF token. Treat this module as unsafe to deploy until
those endpoints validate access and sanitise their input; if you already run it,
audit your site for unexpected entity edits and signature files.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token-cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install the module with Composer and
   enable it.

## How to use it

There is no settings page. After enabling the module you work entirely through
the field UI:

1. Create (or reuse) an **image** field on the content type, user, or other
   entity where you want a signature. In the image field settings it helps to
   uncheck *Alt field required* and *Title field required*.
2. Go to the entity's **Manage form display**, and for that image field choose
   the **Sign** widget. The form now shows a drawing canvas instead of a file
   upload. The module supports multiple signatures and a Bootstrap 5 button
   toolbox.
3. To sign inside rich text, open **Configuration → Content authoring → Text
   formats and editors** (`/admin/config/content/formats`), edit a format that
   uses CKEditor 5, and drag the **Signature** button into the toolbar. When a
   user signs, the drawing is saved as an SVG under the `inline-images` folder.

Because a signature canvas is exposed to whoever can use these fields, give the
signing capability only to trusted roles and keep the safety warning above in
mind.
