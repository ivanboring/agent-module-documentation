Simple Affiliate tracks referrals via a cookie and records the referrer on new user accounts.

---

Simple Affiliate provides a lightweight referral system. A block outputs a per-user affiliate URL pointing at `/simple_affiliate/set-tracking-cookie/{uid}`; visiting it sets a `simple_affiliate` cookie (6-month expiry) with that uid and redirects to the registration form. On `hook_user_insert`, the cookie value is stored into the `field_simple_affiliate_referrals` user entity-reference field, and a 'Simple Affiliate Dashboard' View lists referrals. The tracking route is gated only by `access content` (effectively public), and the referrer uid from the URL/cookie is stored without validation — so referral attribution can be spoofed. Ships field, field-storage and View config.
