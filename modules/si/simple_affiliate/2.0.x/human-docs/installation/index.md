# Installation

## Requirements

- **Drupal 8, 9, or 10** (`core_version_requirement: ^8 || ^9 || ^10`).
- No other modules are required, and there are no third-party Composer or PHP
  library requirements. The module relies on core's user and Views subsystems, which
  are present on a standard site.

## Install with Composer

From the project root:

```bash
composer require drupal/simple_affiliate -W
```

The `-W` (`--with-all-dependencies`) flag lets Composer update any shared
dependencies as needed.

> **Using DDEV?** Prefix Composer and Drush with `ddev` when you run from your host
> machine — `ddev composer require drupal/simple_affiliate -W`, `ddev drush …`.
> Inside the container (`ddev ssh`) run them without the prefix.

## Enable the module

```bash
drush en simple_affiliate -y
```

Enabling installs the referral field (`field_simple_affiliate_referrals`) on user
accounts, its storage, and the Simple Affiliate Dashboard View.

## After installing

There is no configuration form. Place the **Simple Affiliate** block at **Structure
→ Block layout** so members can find their personal affiliate link — see the main
guide's [How to use it](../index.md#how-to-use-it) section.

## A note before you rely on the numbers

As described in the main guide, the tracking route is effectively public and the
referrer id it stores is not validated, so referral counts can be spoofed. Treat the
attribution as good-faith tracking, not an auditable ledger — do not attach real
payouts to it without adding your own verification.
