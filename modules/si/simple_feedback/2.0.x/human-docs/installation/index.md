# Installation

## Requirements

- **Drupal 8, 9, or 10** (`core_version_requirement: ^8 || ^9 || ^10`).
- Core's **Node** and **Block** modules (standard on most sites) — the feedback
  prompt is a block shown on node pages.
- No other contrib dependencies and no extra PHP libraries. In particular, unlike
  heavier voting modules, it does **not** require Voting API.

Note: this project is **not covered by Drupal's security advisory policy**. Take
that into account when deciding whether to run it in production.

## Install with Composer

From the project root:

```bash
composer require drupal/simple_feedback -W
```

The `-W` (`--with-all-dependencies`) flag lets Composer update any shared
dependencies as needed.

> **Using DDEV?** Prefix Composer and Drush with `ddev` when you run from your host
> machine — `ddev composer require drupal/simple_feedback -W`, `ddev drush …`.
> Inside the container (`ddev ssh`) run them without the prefix.

## Enable the module

```bash
drush en simple_feedback -y
```

Enabling the module creates its `simple_feedback` database table, where votes are
stored. There is no settings form.

## Place the block

Go to **Structure → Block layout** (`/admin/structure/block`), click **Place
block** in your chosen region, and add the **Simple Feedback** block. Use the
block's visibility settings to limit it to the content types where a "was this
helpful?" prompt belongs.

## A note before you rely on the data

Both the voting and the tally endpoints are gated only by the core **Access
content** permission, so anonymous visitors can vote, and votes carry no CSRF
token. Deduplication is per node and client IP, which curbs casual repeat voting
but does not make the numbers tamper‑proof. Treat the results as a soft signal of
content usefulness rather than authoritative analytics.

## Verify it worked

Visit a node where you placed the block. You should see "Was this article helpful?
Yes | No". Click one — you should get a short acknowledgement, and a row should
appear in the `simple_feedback` table.
