Manages outbound web-service calls as configuration: define endpoints with headers, params and field mappings, then import the JSON/XML responses into Drupal entities on cron, on node render, or save the raw response to a file.

---

An **endpoint** config entity holds the base URL, HTTP method, response type (json/xml), a parent element path, save-to-entity / save-to-file flags, and multilingual options. Child config entities add **headers**, **params** and **field mappings** (source path in the response → destination field, with per-field options: id/unique field, value field, lowercase, reference-by-distant-id, use-on-delete). `WebServiceManager::endpointCall()` performs the Guzzle request, decodes JSON (via a UTF-16→UTF-8 fixer) or XML (`simplexml_load_string`), then `saveEntity()` creates/updates entities matched on the unique field, converting datetime/image/entity_reference field types (images are downloaded to `public://wsm/images/`) and optionally deleting entities no longer present. Two multilingual modes are supported: `[LANG]` in a source path (one response, per-language paths) or `[LANG]` in the URL (one call per language). A cron task calls all save-enabled endpoints, and a `wsm_endpoint` entity-reference field formatter calls the API live when a referencing node is rendered and themes the result.

Security posture: all admin routes are gated by `administer wsm`; **endpoint URLs, headers and params are admin-configured only**, so server-side fetches (including image downloads from response URLs) are an operator capability, not an unauthenticated SSRF. The Guzzle client uses defaults, so **TLS verification is on** (no `verify => false`). XML is parsed with `simplexml_load_string` without `LIBXML_NOENT`, so external-entity expansion is not enabled (default-safe on PHP 8). Credentials/tokens for the remote API are placed in header/param values (plain config) — store secrets in env-backed config or a header referencing a secret where possible.
