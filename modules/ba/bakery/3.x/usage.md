Bakery provides single sign-on across sites sharing a second-level domain: a parent site issues a signed, encrypted cookie that child sites trust to log the same user in.

---

Running several Drupal sites under one domain — app.example.com, docs.example.com, shop.example.com — and wanting a user to log in once and be recognised everywhere is the classic single-sign-on problem within one organisation. Bakery solves it the cookie way: a designated parent site authenticates the user and issues a cookie, signed and encrypted, that the child sites read and trust to establish the same session. It is a long-standing Drupal SSO approach for sites that share a second-level domain.

Because the cookie *is* the cross-site authentication token, the whole security of the scheme rests on how that cookie is signed, verified and deserialized — and this was reviewed closely (see the module's local security notes). The mechanism is fundamentally sound: HMAC-SHA256 signing with a shared `bakery_key`, encryption of the payload, a freshness check, and — importantly — the signature is verified *before* the payload is deserialized. Two things to know: the signature comparison uses `!==` rather than the constant-time `hash_equals()` (a timing-side-channel weakness in auth-critical code, network-impractical but worth the one-line fix), and the payload is PHP-`serialize`d, so a leak of the shared key would widen SSO forgery into object injection — a JSON payload would be safer.

Operationally, the shared `bakery_key` is the crown jewel: it must be identical across the sites and must never reach version control or a database dump, since anyone with it can forge SSO cookies for any user. For a multi-site-one-domain SSO need, Bakery is the established tool; treat its key with the seriousness of a master credential.
