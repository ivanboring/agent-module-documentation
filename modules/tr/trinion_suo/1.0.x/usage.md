Turns a Trinion site into an online-course platform: hierarchical courses, lessons, tests, per-user progress and access that is unlocked when a course is purchased.

---
Courses are modelled as a `course_categories` taxonomy tree with `urok_kursa` (lesson) and `test` nodes; the `trinion_suo.course` service walks the tree, computes progress, finds the next lesson and enforces access. Lesson view access is controlled in `hook_node_access` via `Course::checkLessonAccess()` — free lessons are open, otherwise the user must have the lesson's course id in `field_ts_course_access`. Enrollment is event-driven: a `trinion_cart` `PaymentEvent::PAYMENT_SUCCESS` subscriber grants course access, flags the buyer as a student, and emails credentials. Learners mark lessons complete via `/complete_lesson/{node}` (AJAX) or the `/lesson-complete/{id}` REST resource, both writing to the current user's completion field; an admin drag-and-drop course builder lives at `/node/{node}/course-structure` (perm `edit any kurs_obucheniya content`). Blocks (course plan, test), a Twig hours/minutes filter, a student access-check service and a "last lesson" views field round it out.

Security-relevant surface: `/complete_lesson/{node}` is gated by `access content` and only mutates the caller's own completion list (bundle-restricted to `urok_kursa`); the `MarkLessonRestResource` GET appends an arbitrary `{id}` to the caller's own reference field without checking it is a lesson (self-scoped, low impact); the `SubscriptionRestResource` POST has its permission check commented out and inserts the posted email into `trinion_suo_subscribers` (parameterized insert — relies solely on REST config permission). Setup: install `trinion_cart`/`inline_entity_form`, build the course taxonomy, and configure the REST resources' permissions before enabling them for anonymous.
