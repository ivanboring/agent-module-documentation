Trinion CRM adds a lightweight sales CRM to Drupal built from node bundles: leads (lead), contacts (contact), companies (kompanii) and deals (sdelki).

---

The module turns ordinary content types into a CRM pipeline. A public contact form submission is captured by `hook_form_alter`/`trinion_crm_contact_form_submit`, which creates a `lead` node from the submitted fields and emails a configurable list of manager users. Leads are then converted into a contact (and optionally a company) through the `/lead-convert` form, and deals (`sdelki`) are numbered automatically per year by `CRMHelper::getNextDocumentNumber()`. Deals can be approved or annulled through an approve endpoint, and every bundle can be exported to a PDF via Dompdf.

Access is layered: list/view of each bundle is gated by four module permissions (`trinion_crm contact/company/lead/sdelki`) enforced in `hook_entity_access`, while the settings form is gated by `administer site configuration`. Note the operational caveat that the PDF export routes (`/pdf/kontakt/{node}`, `/pdf/kompaniya/{node}`, `/pdf/lead/{node}`, `/pdf/sdelka/{node}`) are gated only by the generic `create <bundle> content` permissions rather than the module's own view permissions or per-node view access, so an operator planning the access model should treat the PDF endpoints as reachable by any content author of that bundle. The deal approve endpoint `/utverdit_crm/{node}/{op}` mutates the deal on a plain GET request guarded by a custom access checker (owner or `trinion_base edit all`). Typical setup: enable the module (pulls in `trinion_base`, `contact`, `taxonomy`, `options`), grant the four CRM view permissions plus the relevant `create ... content` permissions to sales roles, and configure the lead-notification recipients and starting deal number at `/admin/config/crm/settings`.
