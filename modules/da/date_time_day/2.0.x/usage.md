Date time day stores a date together with a start and end time on that same day, in one field, rather than as a date range spanning two full datetimes.

---

Core gives you a datetime field and, through `datetime_range`, a range of two datetimes. Neither is the shape of "Tuesday, 9:00 to 17:00". A range technically stores it, but as two independent datetimes, so nothing stops an editor entering an end date on a different day, the widget asks for the date twice, and any query for "what is happening on this day" has to reason about both ends. This field type encodes the constraint in the data: one date, one start time, one end time, all on that day. Everything that follows from that is better — the widget asks for the date once, validation is meaningful, and a view filtered by date does not need to handle a range straddling midnight. Version **2.0.2** on core `^10 || ^11`, depending on core `datetime`. It fits opening hours, class timetables, appointment slots, conference sessions, shift rotas — the large family of things that happen within one day. The boundary is the thing to establish first: **anything crossing midnight does not fit**, so an overnight shift or a session running to 01:00 needs the range field instead, and choosing the wrong one is expensive to reverse once content exists. The other point is **timezones**: a time on a day is only unambiguous once you know whose day it is, so confirm whether the field stores in UTC and renders in the site or user timezone, particularly on a site with an international audience.
