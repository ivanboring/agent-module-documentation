Twilio Otp Login lets users authenticate (and register) with a mobile number and a one-time password delivered via Twilio SMS, instead of a password.

---

The `/login-otp` form (`_access: TRUE`) collects a phone number, the `Otp` service generates a numeric code, hashes it with Drupal's password hasher, stores it in the `twilio_otp_login` table with a short expiry, and sends it through the configured Twilio account. A registration flow (`/register-otp`, `/register-otp/verify`, `/register-otp/resend`) creates new accounts after phone verification, and resend endpoints reissue codes. Twilio SID/token, sender number and message text are configured at `/admin/config/twilio_otp_login/settings` (`administer site configuration`). A redirect event subscriber steers users through the OTP flow.

Setup: enable the module, add Twilio credentials on the settings form, expose the login/registration links, and map the phone field to users. Security notes for this module were reviewed and recorded separately (see the module's security.md — do not modify). Observed while documenting: OTP codes are generated with PHP `rand()` (not a CSPRNG), the OTP/registration/resend routes are unauthenticated (`_access: TRUE`), and the flow has no request throttling — so codes can be requested and guessed without rate limiting; the stored code is hashed and time-limited.
