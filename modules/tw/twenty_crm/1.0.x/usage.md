Integrate with the Twenty CRM API for customer relationship management.

---

Twenty CRM Integration connects Drupal to the Twenty CRM API for customer relationship management — syncing/querying companies and people (contacts) from a Twenty CRM instance, with autocomplete widgets for selecting them in content.

**Security warning (as shipped, 1.0.0):** the autocomplete routes `/twenty-crm/autocomplete/company` and `/twenty-crm/autocomplete/person/{company_uuid}` are `_access: 'TRUE'` (anonymous) and return live CRM records (company names/locations; person names, emails, job titles) with no access check — so an anonymous visitor can enumerate the entire CRM (PII disclosure). **Gate the autocomplete routes behind a permission.** The Twenty CRM API key is handled via a Key entity (`key` dependency, env-backed). Depends on `key`, core `system`, and `tagify`; supports Drupal 9.5+, 10, and 11.
