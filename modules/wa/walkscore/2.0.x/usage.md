Retrieves Walk Score walkability ratings from the Walk Score API for geolocation field values and renders them, with a description, through a Drupal field formatter.

---
Sites that show property or place listings often want a walkability rating. WalkScore adds a field type, widget and formatter (built on the `geolocation` module) so a location's latitude/longitude and address can be sent to the Walk Score API and the returned 0–100 score displayed with a friendly label ("Very Walkable", etc.). The `walkscore.service` (`WalkScore` class) builds a query — API key plus address/lat/lon — against the fixed `https://api.walkscore.com/score` endpoint using the Guzzle HTTP client, decodes the JSON response, maps status codes to messages and returns the score; a `printTest()` helper renders a sample. The API key is configured at `/admin/config/services/walkscore` (`WalkScoreForm`, perm `administer walkscore`).

Security-wise the outbound call targets a hard-coded HTTPS host (no user-controllable endpoint, so no SSRF) and uses Guzzle's default TLS verification (no `verify => false`); the API key is passed as the `wsapikey` query parameter and stored in plain `walkscore.settings` config, as is typical for such keys. The admin config route is permission-gated and there is no anonymous or mutating public endpoint. Setup: get a Walk Score API key, enter it in settings, and add the WalkScore field/formatter to a bundle that has a geolocation value.
