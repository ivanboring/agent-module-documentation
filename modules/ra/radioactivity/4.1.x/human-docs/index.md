# Radioactivity — manual setup guide

**Radioactivity** (`radioactivity`) tracks how popular or "hot" your content is,
using a clever energy‑and‑decay model. You add a special **energy** field to a
content type; every time an entity is viewed, that field *emits* energy (its value
goes up), and Drupal's cron gradually *decays* the energy over time. The result is
that recently‑and‑frequently‑viewed content ranks highest, while interest in older
content naturally fades — so you can build "Trending now" or "Most viewed this
week" listings that stay fresh on their own.

You choose how energy behaves per field via a **profile**:

- **Count** — energy only goes up (+1 per view) and never decays; a plain view
  counter.
- **Linear** — energy rises on each view and loses 1 point per second.
- **Decay** — energy rises on each view and drops by half every configurable
  *half‑life* (exponential decay); this is the default and the most "trending"‑like.

The recommended field type stores the energy on a small dedicated entity that the
content *references*, so recording a view doesn't create a new revision of your node
on every page load. Radioactivity integrates with **Views** so you can sort or
filter "most popular" listings by energy, and it fires an event (and a Rules event)
when an item's energy cools below a cutoff — handy for automatically un‑featuring
stale content. There's also a Drush command to backfill references.

To keep view events accurate even behind aggressive page caches or a decoupled
front end, Radioactivity can send them through a standalone REST file endpoint
instead of the normal Drupal route. Note the emitted events are cryptographically
signed with your site's hash salt, so energy values can't be forged — but the
standalone REST endpoint has no access check of its own, so review the module's
`security.md` before enabling that backend.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer and enable the
   module.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — adding the energy field, the emitter
   formatter, the storage backend, and how decay/cron work.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

Radioactivity has **no central settings page**. All setup happens per field, on the
content type's **Manage fields**, **Manage form display**, and **Manage display**
tabs — plus one storage config object you set with Drush. See
[Configuration](configuration/index.md).

## How to use it

In short: add a **Radioactivity reference** field to your content type, set its
profile and decay options, set the field's **Emitter** formatter on *Manage
display* (which is what emits energy on view), choose a storage backend, and let
cron process and decay the energy. Then sort a view by the field to build your
"trending" listing. The full walkthrough is in
[Configuration](configuration/index.md).
