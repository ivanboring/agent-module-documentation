# Cloudflare AI — manual setup guide

**Cloudflare AI** (`cloudflare_ai`) makes Cloudflare's AI‑group services
first‑class, provisionable resources inside Drupal and provides the clients to use
them. Cloudflare's AI group is a set of hosted building blocks: an **AI Gateway**
that sits in front of AI providers and adds caching, logging, cost analytics and
fallbacks; **Vectorize**, a vector database for semantic search; and **AI Search**
(formerly AutoRAG), a managed pipeline that indexes a data source and answers
questions over it. This module is the layer that lets Drupal provision and talk to
all three.

It's most often used as the foundation for the **Cloudflare AI Gateway
Provider**, which connects the gateway to the Drupal AI module so every AI feature
on your site can route through Cloudflare. But its Vectorize and AI Search clients
can also be called directly from your own code. Each resource — a gateway, a
Vectorize index, an AI Search instance — becomes a configuration entity that other
modules can reference.

This module has **no user‑facing AI features on its own** — it provides the
clients and the configuration that other modules (or your code) build on. It
depends on the [Cloudflare SDK](../../cloudflare_sdk/1.0.x/human-docs/index.md)
and [Cloudflare API](../../cloudflare_api/1.0.x/human-docs/index.md) modules: the
SDK provides the credential framework and shared HTTP client, and the API module
is the standalone Cloudflare v4 client this module calls. Credentials (account ID
and token) are resolved from `settings.php` through the SDK and are **never stored
in configuration**. Note that Workers AI needs no configuration here — it is
stateless inference reached through the AI Gateway, not a resource you provision.

> **Note:** This module absorbed the former standalone *Cloudflare AI Gateway*
> module, which is now obsolete. If you were using that module, move to this one.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install the module (with its SDK and
   API dependencies) with Composer and enable it.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — add a credential set, then add AI
   Gateway, Vectorize and AI Search resources.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

The resources live under **Configuration → Web services**: *Cloudflare AI
Gateways*, *Cloudflare Vectorize*, and *Cloudflare AI Search*. Credential sets
themselves are managed by the Cloudflare SDK at **Configuration → Web services →
Cloudflare credentials**.
