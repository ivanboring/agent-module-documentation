Clover Commerce Sync keeps Drupal Commerce product variations in step with a Clover POS by pulling current prices and stock levels via the Clover REST API and reacting to Clover webhooks.

The `CloverSyncService` matches Clover items to commerce variations by SKU and updates price and (when Commerce Stock is present) stock. Admins configure credentials and run a full sync from `/admin/config/commerce/clover-sync` (both gated on `administer clover commerce sync`). A webhook endpoint at `/clover-sync/webhook` (`_access: 'TRUE'`, POST) receives Clover item-change events; because Clover sends only the changed object id, the module then fetches the current value from the API. Webhook signature verification (`X-Clover-Signature`, HMAC-SHA256, `hash_equals`) is applied only when a webhook secret is configured — with the default empty secret the signature check is skipped and the endpoint accepts unauthenticated POSTs, so configuring the secret is important before relying on webhooks.

Use it to mirror Clover pricing and inventory into a Drupal Commerce storefront in near-real-time, with a manual full-sync fallback.
