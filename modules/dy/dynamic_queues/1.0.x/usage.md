Dynamic Queues splits Drupal queue items into uniquely-named, capacity-limited sub-queues with an inspection dashboard.

---

Dynamic Queues generates uniquely-named sub-queues (`dynamic_queues:<type>_queue_<n>`) so a large volume of queued work can be spread across many queues that each hold up to a configured maximum before a new one is spun up.

The module exposes a settings form (`/admin/dynamic-queues/config`, `access administration pages`) for the per-queue maximum item limit, a QueueWorker plugin plus a derivative that reports each dynamic queue's length, and a dashboard controller that lists the items inside a chosen queue. Helper methods in `DynamicQueueController` read the core `queue` table directly, compute the current highest sub-queue index, and create items via `\Drupal::queue()`. The dashboard route reads queued rows and unserializes their stored `data` blob to display node title / recipient / status columns.

Operationally you enable the module, set the max queue limit, then push items through `loadDatatoDynamicQueues()` from your own code; cron (or drush) processes each sub-queue via the QueueWorker. Note the dashboard route is not permission-gated (see start.md) and unserializes stored queue payloads.
