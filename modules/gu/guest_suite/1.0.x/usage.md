Guest suite integrates a Drupal site with the Guest Suite reviews platform. It defines a `guest_suite_review` content entity, an API consumer that pulls reviews and establishment statistics from the Guest Suite REST API, cron-driven import queues, and tokens for the average rating and total review count.

---

The `ApiConsumer` service calls `https://wire.guest-suite.com/rest/` endpoints (`reviews`, `establishments`, `establishment`, `establishments/statistics`) over HTTPS using the Drupal HTTP client, authenticating with an `access_token` stored in `guest_suite.settings` config and passed as a query parameter. On cron, the `Cron` service enqueues fetch/import jobs into `guest_suite_review_fetcher` / `guest_suite_review_importer` queues to sync reviews into review entities. Two tokens (`guest_suite_average_rate`, `guest_suite_reviews_total_number`) expose aggregate stats for use in blocks/templates.

Configuration lives at `/admin/config/services/guest-suite` and is gated by `administer site configuration`; a review overview page is gated by `access guest suite review overview`. Security notes: the HTTP client uses default TLS verification (no `verify => false`), the API host is a fixed HTTPS URL (no SSRF), and the access token is stored in config — keep config exports out of public repos since the token is a shared secret.
