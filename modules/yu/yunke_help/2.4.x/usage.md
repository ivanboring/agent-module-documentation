Yunke help is a developer study/debugging helper that exposes a suite of Drupal introspection and maintenance endpoints under `/yunke-help/*`, all gated by a single `yunke help` permission.

---

It is aimed at developers learning Drupal internals: routes dump the service container (static and runtime), event-dispatcher listeners, theme registry, plugin data, entity/field/schema definitions, route lookups, and YAML encode/decode; a set of forms explore fields, hooks, menu trees and multistep-form patterns. Maintenance routes truncate every `cache_*` table, clear compiled Twig templates, rebuild routes/theme registry, delete unused managed files, rotate the cron key, and show `phpinfo()`. A "reset password" route lets the current logged-in user set a new password for their own account without entering the old one.

Operationally this is a powerful debugging toolbox that should never be enabled on production. Security-relevant facts observed in the code: the `yunke help` permission is NOT declared `restrict access: TRUE` (`yunke_help.permissions.yml`), yet it unlocks `phpinfo()` (which discloses environment variables and secrets), full cache-table truncation, and complete container/parameter dumps. The reset-password route only ever resets the *current* user's own password (uid from `currentUser()`), so it is not a cross-user privilege escalation, but the new password is echoed in plaintext. Several controllers `echo … die`, bypassing the render pipeline. Grant `yunke help` to trusted developers only and keep the module out of production.
