PDB File Viewer is a file-field formatter that displays molecular structure files using the NGL Viewer library.

---

The formatter (`src/Plugin/Field/FieldFormatter/PDBFileViewer.php`) renders a `<div id="viewport">` and attaches the NGL library plus `drupalSettings` (filename, file URL, extension) so NGL can load and draw the structure client-side. It supports formats such as pdb, ent, cif/mmcif, gro, pqr, mol2, sdf and mmtf. Per-display settings let you also show the file name as a link and/or the file size, cap rendering by a maximum byte size, and (with the fallback_formatter module) return nothing when the format is unrecognized. A global settings form (`/admin/config/user-interface/pdb_file_viewer`, `administer site configuration`) chooses the supported extension list, an "allow all extensions" switch, and whether to load NGL from a CDN (`https://unpkg.com/ngl@0.10.4/...` by default) or a local copy.

Security-relevant notes for operators: the file rendered is a managed file entity obtained via `getEntitiesToView()`, so file access is enforced by core and the file path is not request-controlled — there is no path-traversal or arbitrary-file-read vector (the computed `realpath()` is not used to read files server-side; NGL fetches the public file URL client-side). Two things to be aware of: by default the JS library is loaded from a third-party CDN (supply-chain/privacy consideration — switch to the local copy for hardened sites), and the file's own filename is concatenated into markup for the link without escaping (a theoretical stored-XSS only if a privileged uploader crafts a malicious filename). Typical setup: choose the formatter on a file field, set the extension list and CDN/local option.
