Migrate Source Directory adds a migrate **source plugin** that reads a directory of files, so a folder of documents, images or HTML becomes migration rows without a CSV listing them first.

---

Migrate's source plugins cover databases, CSV, JSON, XML and URLs; the filesystem itself is a gap. Importing a folder of a thousand PDFs therefore starts with generating a manifest — a script producing a CSV of filenames, which then has to be regenerated whenever the folder changes. This plugin removes that step: point a migration at a directory and each file becomes a row, with its path and metadata available as source properties for the process pipeline to map onto a file or media entity. The module is small — `src/Plugin` plus `config/schema` — with core `migrate` as its only dependency and no routes, permissions or configuration UI, which is right for a plugin consumed from migration YAML. Core requirement is `^9 || ^10 || ^11`. Two practical notes: the directory is read at migration time, so a source that changes between a `migrate:status` and a `migrate:import` will behave accordingly; and because migration configuration decides which directory is read, that path is chosen by whoever writes the migration — a developer, not an end user.
