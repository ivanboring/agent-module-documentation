# Layout Builder Simplify — manual setup guide

**Layout Builder Simplify** (`layout_builder_simplify`) makes core **Layout
Builder**'s "Choose a block" screen easier to work with on sites that have a lot of
blocks. Core shows every available block in a single long off‑canvas list. This
module replaces that with a **category‑first**, two‑step chooser: the first screen
lists only the block **categories**, and picking a category opens a second screen
showing just that category's blocks, with a name filter and a "Back" link to return
to the category list.

The **Custom** category is handled specially: instead of listing everything, it
shows the 20 most‑recently‑updated content blocks and adds a type‑ahead
**autocomplete search**, so on a site with a large custom‑block library editors can
type part of a block's label to find it quickly. Each entry in the recent list shows
the block's type and when it was last changed.

It is a drop‑in enhancement — enabling the module changes the chooser everywhere
Layout Builder is used, and there is nothing to configure. Block *placement* still
runs through core's own routes, so who may place a block and what access those blocks
have is unchanged. It depends on core Layout Builder (and core System).

**One operational note for site builders.** The autocomplete uses an endpoint,
`/block-search.json`, that is gated only by the *access content* permission — which
anonymous users hold by default. It returns custom‑block labels, UUIDs and type
labels for keyword matches (the query is safely parameterized, so there is no SQL
injection risk), but it does expose your custom‑block inventory more broadly than the
layout editor itself. If your custom‑block labels are sensitive, tighten who holds
*access content* or add a stricter access check before a public launch.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install the module with Composer and
   enable it.

There is **no settings form** for this module — enabling it changes the block
chooser immediately. How the new chooser behaves is described below.

## How to use it

Nothing to set up beyond enabling the module. Wherever Layout Builder is used:

1. Edit a page's layout in **Layout Builder** and click **Add block**.
2. The off‑canvas chooser now shows block **categories** first.
3. Click a category to see just that category's blocks, and type in the filter to
   narrow the list. Use **Back** to return to the category list.
4. Under **Custom**, you'll see the 20 most recently updated content blocks, plus a
   search box that autocompletes custom blocks by their label as you type.
