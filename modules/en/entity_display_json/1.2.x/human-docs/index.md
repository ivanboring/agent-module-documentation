# Entity Display JSON — manual setup guide

**Entity Display JSON** (`entity_display_json`) is a **read‑only JSON API for Drupal
entities driven by your existing Manage Display configuration**. Instead of
hand‑writing a field map or rebuilding render arrays, you configure a view display
once and get a stable JSON contract: hidden fields stay hidden, view modes propagate
to referenced entities, and label settings come through. It's aimed at decoupled and
headless front ends — React, Vue, Svelte, native apps, edge renderers — that want
the same field visibility and formatter settings as a configured display mode.

It exposes three endpoints, all gated by a single permission, **"Access Entity
Display JSON endpoints"**:

- `GET /ejson` — site name, slogan, language map, and a homepage pointer.
- `GET /ejson/resolve?path=/about-us` — translates a path or alias into an
  `{entity_type, uuid, id, display_id}` pointer your front end can follow.
- `GET /ejson/{entity_type}/{uuid}/{display_id}` — serializes an entity (or view)
  using the named view display (`display_id` defaults to `default`).

Highlights include one‑call full‑page output (referenced entities, paragraphs, media,
and files are walked recursively using each component's view mode), automatic
cacheability (cache tags and contexts bubble into a cacheable JSON response),
multilingual support via `?lang=xx`, safe recursion that marks cycles/deep nesting
with `_stub` instead of looping, and integrations that are picked up automatically
when present (Views, Field Group, Block Field, Paragraphs). It's also extensible
without forking, via field‑value‑extractor plugins and several alter hooks. It
requires **Drupal 10.2+ or 11**.

**Important access consideration.** In this version the endpoint enforces **per‑field**
view access (fields the current user can't see are omitted) but does **not** perform
an **entity‑level** access check: the controller loads the entity by UUID via a
storage load (which bypasses access) and serializes it without an
`$entity->access('view')` check. Because core field‑view access doesn't take a node's
published status or node‑access grants into account, a holder of the endpoint
permission can read the display fields (title, body, and so on) of entities they
couldn't otherwise view — including **unpublished nodes** and content hidden by
node‑access modules — as long as those individual fields aren't restricted. Treat the
**"Access Entity Display JSON endpoints"** permission as effectively **read‑any‑entity**:
grant it only to fully trusted consumers. If you can, add an `$entity->access('view')`
check in the controller (returning 403/404 on deny) before exposing it more widely.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer, enable the module,
   and grant the endpoint permission.

There is **no dedicated settings form** — the JSON output is shaped by your entities'
**Manage Display** configuration (plus optional per‑field third‑party settings and
code‑level extension points), and the endpoints are controlled by a single
permission.

## Where it lives / how to use it

1. Enable the module and grant **"Access Entity Display JSON endpoints"** (under
   **People → Permissions**) to the roles or API consumers that should reach the
   API — remembering the access consideration above.
2. Configure how your content should appear under **Structure → (entity type) →
   Manage display** for the view mode you intend to serve. Whatever you show or hide
   there is what appears in the JSON.
3. Call the endpoints: start with `GET /ejson`, resolve a path with
   `GET /ejson/resolve?path=/your-path`, then fetch the entity with
   `GET /ejson/{entity_type}/{uuid}/{display_id}`. Append `?lang=xx` for a specific
   translation.
