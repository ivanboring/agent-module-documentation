# Installation

## Requirements

- **Drupal 9, 10, or 11** (`core_version_requirement: ^9||^10||^11`).
- No module dependencies and no third‑party library requirements.

## Install with Composer

From the project root:

```bash
composer require drupal/entity_confirmation -W
```

The `-W` (`--with-all-dependencies`) flag lets Composer update any shared
dependencies as needed.

> **Using DDEV?** Prefix Composer and Drush with `ddev` when you run from your host
> machine — `ddev composer require drupal/entity_confirmation -W`, `ddev drush …`.
> Inside the container (`ddev ssh`) run them without the prefix.

## Enable the module

```bash
drush en entity_confirmation -y
```

## Verify it worked

Configure a custom confirmation message and redirect on an entity's form mode for one
operation (for example editing an Article), then perform that operation. You should
see your custom message instead of the default, and be redirected to the destination
you chose.
