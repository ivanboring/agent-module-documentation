# Entity Deep Token — manual setup guide

**Entity Deep Token** (`entity_deep_token`) lets tokens reach **deep into an
entity's chain of references**, not just its own fields. Drupal's built‑in token
system only follows one‑level relationships; this module defines a new token type,
`entity_deep_token`, that can hop across multiple entity‑reference fields to pull a
value from a related entity several levels away.

The syntax traverses reference fields using `:entity:` steps and ends with the
property you want. For example, if a *degree* node references a *department*, which
references a *school*:

```
[entity-deep-token:field_department:entity:field_school:entity:id]     → the school node's ID
[entity-deep-token:field_department:entity:field_school:entity:label]  → the school node's title
[entity-deep-token:field_department:entity:field_school:entity:bundle] → the school node's bundle
```

You can also read raw field values, such as a related node's creation timestamp:
`[entity-deep-token:field_related_node:entity:created:value]`. This is handy for
hierarchical breadcrumbs, metadata built from related entities, and custom URL or
conditional logic.

It depends on the **Token** module and works wherever tokens are processed, as long
as there's an entity context (node, user, taxonomy term, and so on). A couple of
current limitations: it reads only the **first value** of a multi‑value reference
field, and it does **not** format raw values (timestamps come through unformatted).

**A security note worth keeping in mind:** a deep token can surface a value from a
referenced entity that the current viewer might not be allowed to see — token
replacement does not itself enforce entity access. So be careful **where** you place
these tokens; don't embed a deep token that resolves restricted referenced data into
output shown to unauthorized users.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer, pull in the Token
   dependency, and enable the module.

There is **no configuration page** — the module simply makes the
`entity_deep_token` token type available for you to use.

## How to use it

Once enabled, use the token type `entity_deep_token` in any token‑aware place that
has an entity context. Build the token by chaining reference field names with
`:entity:` steps and finishing with the property you want (`id`, `label`, `bundle`,
`value`, `target_id`, and so on), as in the examples above.
