# Entity Copy with Reference — manual setup guide

**Entity Copy with Reference** (`entity_copy_reference`) gives content managers a
configurable, **one‑click way to copy (clone) a node** — and, crucially, lets you
decide what happens to the entities that node references. It grew out of a very
practical need: editors who wanted to duplicate a page without hand‑copying every
field, and without wrestling with complicated configuration.

The interesting part is how it handles reference fields. When you clone a node,
each of its reference fields can be treated in one of three ways: **clear all
references** on the copy, **keep the reference** pointing at the same entity as the
original, or **duplicate the referenced entity as well** so the copy gets its own
independent version. The classic example is Paragraphs inside a node — you almost
always want those duplicated, so editing the new node's paragraphs doesn't
accidentally change the original.

The module works only after you configure it: you first choose which content types
should be copyable, then set the per‑reference behavior for each of those types.
It currently supports **nodes only** (taxonomy support is planned). Cloning creates
real content, so it respects normal create permissions plus the module's own
permission — gate who is allowed to clone. There are no third‑party dependencies.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install the module with Composer and
   enable it.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — choose copyable content types and set
   how each reference field is handled on copy.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

Once enabled, the module's settings form (route `entity_copy_reference.form`) is
where you turn copying on for specific content types and configure how their
references behave. See [Configuration](configuration/index.md) for the full
walkthrough. After that, a copy action becomes available on nodes of the enabled
content types for users who hold the module's permission.
