# Configuration

Setup is short: choose which languages the side‑by‑side interface loads by
default, and grant the permission to the roles that should use it.

## Open the settings form

1. Log in as an administrator.
2. Go to `/admin/config/system/entity-translate-side-by-side`.

## Choose the default languages

On the settings page, **select the languages to be loaded by default** in the
side‑by‑side interface. These are the language columns a translator sees when they
open the translation screen. Users can adjust which languages they work with, but
these defaults set the starting point. Save the form when you're done.

## Grant the permission

The module adds a dedicated permission, **Access Entity Translate Side by Side**.
Assign it to the roles that should be able to use the side‑by‑side translation
screen:

1. Go to **People → Permissions** (`/admin/people/permissions`).
2. Find **Access Entity Translate Side by Side** and tick the box for each role
   that should have it.
3. Save permissions.

Remember that this permission only controls access to the side‑by‑side interface.
The underlying right to translate content is still governed by Drupal core's
content‑translation permissions, so make sure your translators also have those.

## Using it

With the defaults and permission in place, open a translatable entity, choose
**"Translate side by side"** from the operations dropdown, and edit the languages
next to each other. Only translations you actually change are saved, and you can
drag‑and‑drop to navigate the languages.
