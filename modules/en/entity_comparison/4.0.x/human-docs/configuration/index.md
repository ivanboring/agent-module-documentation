# Configuration

Setting up a comparison is a few‑step process: create the comparison, choose which
fields it displays, place the add/remove link where visitors will click it, and
grant the permission that lets people use it. This page walks through each step.

## 1. Create a comparison

1. Log in as a user with the **Administer entity comparison** permission.
2. Go to **Structure → Entity comparison → Add**
   (`/admin/structure/entity_comparison/add`).
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Label** and **machine name** — the human name and internal id.
   - **Add to comparison list** — the text of the *add* link (for example "Add to
     compare").
   - **Remove from comparison** — the text of the *remove* link.
   - **Limit** — the maximum number of items a visitor may add. Enter **0** for no
     limit; a value like 3 or 4 keeps the table readable.
   - **Entity type** and **Bundle** — what visitors will be comparing (for example
     *Content* → *Product*).
4. Save.

Saving a **new** comparison does a fair amount of automatic setup: it creates a
dedicated view mode named after the comparison, rebuilds the site's routes so the
`/compare/...` page exists, and clears caches. If the compare page or its
permission does not show up right away, run `drush cr`.

## 2. Choose which fields are compared

The comparison table shows the fields you enable in the comparison's own view
mode:

1. Go to the target bundle's **Manage display** tab — for example **Structure →
   Content types → Product → Manage display**.
2. Switch to the custom display named after your comparison (it appears in the
   view‑mode list).
3. Enable and order the fields you want in the table. **Row order here is the row
   order in the comparison table**, and formatter settings apply as usual. Only
   the fields you enable appear.

## 3. Place the add/remove link

There are three ways to give visitors the link, all producing the same clickable
add/remove control:

- **In an entity display** — on the target bundle's **Manage display** for any
  view mode (Default, Teaser, …), enable the *"Link for entity comparison"*
  component. This is the usual way to put an "Add to compare" link on listing/
  teaser pages.
- **As a Views field** — in any view of that bundle, add the comparison‑link
  field.
- **As a block** — place the per‑comparison *add/remove link* block from
  **Structure → Block layout**.

There is also a second block per comparison that links to the comparison page and
shows the current item count — handy for a header "Compare (2)" indicator.

## 4. Grant the permission

Each comparison generates its own permission, **"*(label)*: Use entity
comparison"**. A visitor needs it to see the add/remove link and to open the
compare page.

1. Go to **People → Permissions** (`/admin/people/permissions`).
2. Grant *Use entity comparison* for your comparison to the roles that should have
   it (including **Anonymous user** if you want logged‑out visitors to compare).
3. Rebuild caches (`drush cr`) after creating a new comparison so its permission
   and route appear.

The separate **Administer entity comparison** permission controls who can create,
edit, and delete comparisons in the admin UI — keep that to trusted administrators.

## The comparison page

The compare page lives at `/compare/{id}`, where the id uses dashes in place of
underscores (a comparison called `my_products` is at `/compare/my-products`). It
loads the visitor's session list and renders each entity's fields through the
comparison's view mode, with a "Remove from the list" row across the top. Lists
are per browser session and clear when the session ends.

## Security: before exposing a comparison publicly

The add/remove action has some gaps worth understanding (full write‑up in this
module's root `security.md`):

- The action route is gated only by core's *Access content*, not by the
  comparison's own *use* permission, and it performs **no entity‑level access
  check** and **no check that the entity actually belongs to the configured
  bundle**. It is also a state‑changing GET with **no CSRF token**.
- The practical effect: a user who holds *use ... entity comparison* can seed the
  list with arbitrary entity ids of that entity type and have their fields
  rendered on the compare page, bypassing entity access.

If you must expose this publicly, mitigate by:

- Keeping the comparison's view mode limited to fields that are safe for any
  visitor of that bundle.
- Restricting the *use ... entity comparison* permission to authenticated roles.
- Implementing `hook_entity_comparison_rows_alter()` (or a route access check)
  that filters the compared entities through an `access('view')` check before the
  table is built.

## Extending the table (developers)

`hook_entity_comparison_rows_alter(&$header, &$rows, $comparison_context)` lets you
add, remove, or rewrite rows before the table renders — for example to add a
computed "verdict" or "score" row. The context carries the comparison config, the
entities, and the comparison fields.
