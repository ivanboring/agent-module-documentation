# Entity Count — manual setup guide

**Entity Count** (`entity_count`) adds a simple admin **report of how many entities
exist on your site**, broken down by type and, where a type has more than one
bundle, by bundle. It's a census: at a glance you can see how many nodes, users,
taxonomy terms, and other entities are stored in the database — handy for keeping
tabs on content growth and for reasoning about performance.

The report lives under **Reports**, and access to it is gated by an **"Access entity
count"** permission. There's nothing to configure — enable the module, grant the
permission, and the report is ready.

One thing worth knowing: the totals are **raw counts that include entities the
current viewer can't necessarily access** (for example unpublished nodes or other
users' private content). The report only ever shows **aggregate numbers** — never
titles, IDs, or individual rows — and both of its routes require the permission, so
in practice a trusted admin simply sees accurate totals. Because it can reveal the
existence of otherwise‑hidden content as a number, grant the permission only to
trusted administrators.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer, enable the
   module, and grant the report permission.

There is **no configuration page** for this module — it works as soon as it's
enabled and the permission is granted.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

Once enabled, you'll find the **Entity count** link under **Administration →
Reports** (`/admin/reports`). Click it to see the list of entity types, their
counts, and a per‑bundle breakdown for types that have multiple bundles.
