# Configuration

Entity Inherit needs one piece of setup: telling it **which field(s) define an
entity's parent**. Everything else happens automatically when entities are saved.

## Set up the parent field

1. **Create a parent field.** On the bundles that should inherit, add a field that
   marks an entity's parent — typically an **entity‑reference** field, for example
   named `field_entity_inherit_parent`. This field holds the reference from a child
   to its parent entity.
2. **Register it with Entity Inherit.** Go to `/admin/config/entity_inherit` (the
   settings form, gated by the **Access administration pages** permission) and enter
   that field's machine name as a parent field. The setting is stored in the
   module's configuration.
3. **Match field names.** For any field to actually inherit, the parent and the
   child must use the **same field name**. Only fields that exist on both, by the
   same name, participate.

## How propagation behaves

Once a parent field is registered, the module acts on **every entity save**:

- **A parent's field changes.** If a parent field's value changes and a child
  previously held the parent's *old* value, the child is updated to the new value.
- **A new parent link is added.** If an entity gains a parent reference, its *empty*
  fields that also exist on the parent are filled in from the parent.
- **Large sets are queued.** When many entities are affected, propagation runs
  through the module's queue (a batch or non‑batch processor) rather than all at
  once.
- **No data lock‑in.** Values are recomputed and stored on save, so you can disable
  or uninstall the module later without losing the inherited data.

## Cautions to plan around

- **No access checks.** Propagation writes to child and parent entities regardless
  of the acting user's edit or view permissions. Control this by restricting which
  fields are used as parent fields and who can edit parent entities.
- **No cross‑save loop protection.** The module only guards a single save against
  loops. Avoid circular parent graphs (A → B → A), which will produce errors.

## Extending it (developers)

Inheritance behavior can be extended with the module's plugin system by
implementing an `EntityInheritPlugin`. The module bundles example plugins (handling
legacy field formats, queue processing, and removing system fields) to learn from —
see the sibling [`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs for specifics.
