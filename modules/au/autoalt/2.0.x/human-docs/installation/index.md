# Installation

## Requirements

- **Drupal 10 or 11** (`core_version_requirement: ^10 || ^11`).
- Core's **Image** module (`image`), enabled — Drupal enables it automatically as
  a dependency.
- An **AutoAlt.ai account and API key** (from https://autoalt.ai). Generating alt
  text consumes credits tied to that key.
- No third-party Composer or PHP library requirements.

## Install with Composer

From the project root:

```bash
composer require drupal/autoalt -W
```

The `-W` (`--with-all-dependencies`) flag lets Composer update any shared
dependencies as needed.

> **Using DDEV?** Prefix Composer and Drush with `ddev` when you run from your
> host machine — `ddev composer require drupal/autoalt -W`, `ddev drush …`.
> Inside the container (`ddev ssh`) run them without the prefix.

## Enable the module

```bash
drush en autoalt -y
```

## After enabling

- Enter your AutoAlt.ai API key on the settings form, as described in
  [Configuration](../configuration/index.md).
- **Before exposing the site publicly, review access to
  `/api/autoalt/generate`.** As shipped, that endpoint is gated only by "access
  content" (effectively anonymous on most sites) even though it loads any file by
  id and forwards it to AutoAlt.ai with your API key. Restrict it — for example
  at the web server, or by tightening the permission — to avoid unauthenticated
  credit abuse and disclosure of file contents. See the overview page and the
  module's `security.md` for the full finding.
