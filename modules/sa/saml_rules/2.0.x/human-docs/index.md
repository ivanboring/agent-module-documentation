# SAML Rules — manual setup guide

**SAML Rules** (`saml_rules`) sits on top of the SAML Authentication
(`samlauth`) module and lets you decide what should happen to a user account the
moment someone signs in through your identity provider (IdP). Instead of hand‑
editing accounts, you write rules that fire automatically on login: give a person
a role because their SAML data says they belong to a certain group, set or
correct their email address, or copy attribute values from the IdP straight into
custom fields on the user profile.

It solves a very common single sign‑on headache. Many IdPs send group,
department or entitlement information as SAML attributes, and some send a
duplicated or empty email address. SAML Rules turns those attributes into
concrete Drupal actions — role assignment, email normalisation and
attribute‑to‑field mapping — using simple `[attribute]` placeholders so you can
build quite custom mappings without writing code.

The module does nothing until you configure it: enabling it adds the admin
screens and the login hook, but you have to create at least one rule before any
change takes effect. It requires the `samlauth` module and has no submodules.

Please read one important caveat before you rely on this for anything sensitive.
The login logic reads the incoming SAML response and applies your role and email
rules **without verifying the SAML signature** on that response. In practice that
means a forged or unsigned response submitted during login could drive role
assignment or email changes on the account being logged in — a potential
privilege‑escalation path. Treat role provisioning through this module with care,
keep it to trusted environments, and understand the risk before granting
privileged roles from IdP attributes.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer, enable the
   module alongside `samlauth`.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — the two rule types, the admin
   matrices, and the settings form, field by field.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

Once enabled, the module's screens live under
**Configuration → People → SAML Rules** (`/admin/config/people/saml-rules`).
Every route there is gated by the **Administer SAML Rules**
(`administer saml rules`) permission, so only trusted administrators can create
or change rules. You will find matrix views for authentication rules and for
user‑field rules, add/edit/delete forms for each, and a general settings form.

## How to use it

The rules you build run automatically on SAML login — there is no button to
press per user. Set up `samlauth` with your IdP first, define your authentication
and user‑field rules here, then test with a real login and confirm the account
received the roles, email and field values you expect.
