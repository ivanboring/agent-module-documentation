Zoho SalesIQ adds the Zoho SalesIQ live-chat and visitor-tracking widget to your site by injecting the snippet you paste from your Zoho account into every (or non-admin) page.

---

The module (machine name `zohosalesiq`; project/on-disk name `salesiq`) stores a widget-code snippet in `zohosalesiq.settings`, editable at `/admin/config/services/zohosalesiq` under the `administer zohosalesiq` permission. `hook_page_attachments()` validates the snippet against a regex, rewrites the widget URL to add `plugin_source=drupal`, and outputs it as an inline `<script>` in the head. It can optionally hide the chat float button (tracking-only mode) and can be limited to view pages only (excluding admin/node-edit routes). For logged-in users it also emits an inline script calling `$zoho.salesiq.visitor.name(...)` / `.email(...)` with the current user's own display name and email. Because the widget code is only settable by a trusted `administer zohosalesiq` admin (who can already add scripts), and the prefilled visitor name/email belong to the viewing user themselves, there is no cross-user injection — the visitor-info values are not JS-escaped, so a self-chosen malicious username would only affect that same user's page (self-XSS). No server-side HTTP calls are made from PHP.
