Seeds Layout Builder layouts and clones inline blocks (and nested paragraphs) from the source language into new translations, with per-block push to translations.

---

LB Translation Block Seed automatically seeds a new translation's Layout Builder layout from the source language, cloning inline blocks (and any nested Paragraph entities) into language-specific copies so each translation can be edited independently without affecting the original.

When a translation is created, a hook handler invokes `LayoutSeeder`, which copies the source sections and components, uses `InlineBlockCloneService`/`ParagraphCloneService` to duplicate inline block content per language, and preserves component ordering and UUIDs; it integrates with `layout_builder_at` (async translation) and supports Content Moderation. Beyond initial seeding, editors can flag selected components on the source entity for push to one or more translations (`processPushedBlocks()` reads a `_push_translations` marker on the component's `additional` data and re-clones just those blocks). The single permission `push layout builder block translations` (restricted) gates the push feature. The clone path calls `unserialize()` on the Layout Builder `block_serialized` value from the component configuration (LayoutSeeder.php:155); this mirrors core Layout Builder's own tempstore handling and operates on layout data authored by users with edit access, not on raw request input.

Typical setup: enable the module (with its layout_builder_at dependency), grant the push permission to translators, then create translations — layouts seed automatically, and use the per-block push to propagate source changes.
