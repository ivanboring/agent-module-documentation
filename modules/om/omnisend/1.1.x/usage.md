Omnisend connects Drupal to the Omnisend marketing platform, syncing form submissions as contacts and surfacing lists and campaigns in an admin dashboard.

---

The module provides an `OmnisendApi` service that calls Omnisend's REST API (`api.omnisend.com` / `a.omnisend.com`) to fetch lists and campaigns and to create/subscribe contacts (`syncContact()` posts email plus optional name/address/demographic fields). A Webform handler plugin (`OmnisendFormHandler`) lets a Webform push submissions to Omnisend on submit. Admin screens include a settings form at `/admin/config/services/omnisend` (`administer site configuration`) for the API key and a dashboard/campaigns view (`access omnisend dashboard`).

API calls use Guzzle with default TLS verification (enabled) and hard-coded Omnisend endpoints, so there is no SSRF surface and no disabled certificate checking. The API key is stored in the `omnisend.settings` config object and sent as an `X-API-KEY`/`Omnisend-API-Key` header — because it lives in config it is included in config exports, so treat exported config as sensitive (or supply the key via an override); best practice would be a Key entity or state. Note the dashboard permission is referenced but not defined by a `permissions.yml`, so those routes are effectively limited to user 1 until the permission is provided.
