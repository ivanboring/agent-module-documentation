Commerce Stripe Sofort provides an off-site payment gateway for the Sofort payment method through Stripe, completing orders from a Stripe webhook that re-verifies the charge server-side.
---
The gateway plugin (`src/Plugin/Commerce/PaymentGateway/StripeSofort.php`) and offsite form set up the Sofort/Stripe redirect, and a `StripeWebhookController` (`src/Controller/StripeWebhookController.php`) receives Stripe's asynchronous notification at `/stripe-sofort-webhook`. On webhook, `capture()` reads the JSON body and `updateOrder()` takes only the charge id, **re-fetches the charge from Stripe** (`Charge::retrieve($chargeId)`), derives the order from the re-fetched charge's `source.metadata.order_id`, and completes the order only when the authoritative `$charge->paid == TRUE`. A `commerce_log` category/template set records payment events.

Setup: add a "Stripe Sofort" gateway with your Stripe API keys, configure the Stripe webhook to point at `/stripe-sofort-webhook`, and enable the Sofort payment method in Stripe. The module also emits a `CommerceStripeSofortEvent` for custom reactions. A security finding for this module already exists in the knowledge base and is not repeated here; consult that file for the webhook-authentication detail.
