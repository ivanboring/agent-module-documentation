Commerce Purchasable Entity provides a lightweight alternative to Commerce's product/variation pair: a single `commerce_purchasable_entity` type with a price and a store reference, for cases where the full product model is more structure than the shop needs.

---

Drupal Commerce models sellable things as a product with one or more variations, which is powerful but heavy when you are selling, say, event tickets, memberships or single-SKU services. This module defines a minimal purchasable entity instead: a bundleable content entity (`commerce_purchasable_entity` with a `commerce_purchasable_entity_type` bundle entity) carrying the fields Commerce actually requires of a purchasable — a price and a store — and implementing Commerce's purchasable-entity interface so it can be referenced by an order item type and go through cart, checkout, tax and promotions like any product variation. It ships its own storage handler, access control handler, list builders for both entities and their types, entity forms, and a `PurchasableEntityHtmlRouteProvider` giving it a full admin UI with menu, action and task links. Permissions follow the usual Commerce shape: a restricted `administer commerce_purchasable_entity_type` for bundle configuration plus create/edit/delete/view permissions for the entities themselves. It depends on `commerce`, `commerce_price` and `commerce_store`.
