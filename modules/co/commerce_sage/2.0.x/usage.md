Commerce SagePay integration lets a Drupal Commerce store take card payments through the SagePay/Opayo API as an on-site gateway. Card details are collected on the store, a transaction is created via the SagePay REST API, and a 3-D Secure challenge is completed via a dedicated return endpoint before the order is marked paid.

---

Install with Composer (`drupal/commerce_sage`) and enable it (depends on commerce and commerce_payment). Create a 'SagePay (On-site)' payment gateway and enter the vendor name plus live/test integration key and password and transaction/security options. The gateway posts to the SagePay transactions API and returns the buyer through /3dSecureBack/{order} to finish 3-D Secure. Store the integration credentials as secrets. Review the 3-D Secure return controller (agent notes) before production: it does not bind the verified transaction to the order.
