# Configuration

Sberbank Acquiring is configured like any Drupal Commerce payment gateway — you
add a gateway entity and fill in its settings.

## Before you start: store your API credentials as secrets

The Sberbank API **username and password** are secrets. Keep them out of
version-controlled configuration by holding the value in an environment variable
and exposing it through a **Key** entity:

1. Save the value into DDEV's env file (never commit `.ddev/.env`):
   ```bash
   ddev dotenv set .ddev/.env --sberbank-api-password=<value>
   ddev restart
   ```
2. Make sure the Key module is available:
   ```bash
   ddev composer require drupal/key
   ddev drush en key -y
   ```
3. Create a Key that reads the environment variable:
   ```bash
   ddev drush key:save sberbank_api_password --label='Sberbank API password' \
     --key-type=authentication --key-provider=env \
     --key-provider-settings='{"env_variable":"SBERBANK_API_PASSWORD","base64_encoded":false,"strip_line_breaks":true}' \
     --key-input=none -y
   ```

Where the gateway form has no Key selector, override the secret from
`settings.php` rather than committing it.

## Add the payment gateway

1. Go to **Commerce → Configuration → Payment gateways**
   (`/admin/commerce/config/payment-gateways`) and click **Add payment gateway**.
2. Give it a **Name** (for example "Card payment (Sberbank)").
3. Choose the **Sberbank Acquiring** plugin.

## Gateway settings, field by field

- **Payment mode (Test / Live)** — Sberbank provides separate test and live REST
  APIs, each with its own username and password. Start in **Test** and only move
  to **Live** once test transactions reconcile cleanly. The credentials are
  *different* per mode, so switching mode means switching credentials too.
- **Username** — the Sberbank API username for the selected mode.
- **Password** — the Sberbank API password for the selected mode. Supply this
  from the Key/secret you created above rather than pasting a production secret
  into the form.

## Save and test

Click **Save**, then place a test order. The module registers the order with
Sberbank and confirms the payment status back through Sberbank's API. Sberbank
publishes test card numbers you can use — check their documentation for the
current list.

## Security reminder

- Serve checkout over **HTTPS** and keep credentials in secrets, not in exported
  config.
- Payment status is confirmed **server-side** against Sberbank's authenticated
  API — that is the correct model; don't replace it with anything that trusts a
  client-supplied return.
- Remember this project is **not covered by the security advisory policy**, so
  monitor it and apply updates yourself.
