Commerce Payrexx integration provides Commerce integration for the Payrexx payment gateway.

---

Commerce Payrexx integration provides a Drupal Commerce payment gateway for Payrexx — a Swiss payment
service — supporting a redirect checkout (customer pays on Payrexx) and processing payment results via return
and webhook. It depends on Drupal Commerce, in the Commerce (contrib) package.

Use it to accept payments through Payrexx. Its security handling is **correct**: on the webhook, it treats
the posted transaction as **untrusted and re-fetches the transaction from Payrexx's authenticated API**
(using the gateway's instance name + secret) before acting — the controller literally notes *"The transaction
data is untrusted to this point. Reload the transaction data from the remote server to ensure the data can be
trusted."* — and the redirect checkout uses Payrexx's `SignatureCheck`. So a forged webhook cannot mark an
order paid (the authoritative status comes from Payrexx). When adopting: store the Payrexx **API secret as a
secret** (not in exported config), operate over HTTPS, and confirm the gateway is in the correct (test vs
live) mode. Configure the Payrexx credentials.
