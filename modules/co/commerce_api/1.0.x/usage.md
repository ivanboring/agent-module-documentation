Commerce API exposes Drupal Commerce over JSON:API for decoupled storefronts: cart, checkout and store resources, an anonymous **cart token** so a JS front end can hold a cart without a Drupal session, and webhook endpoints for order state transitions.

---

The module builds on `jsonapi_resources` and `jsonapi_hypermedia` rather than reinventing a REST layer. Custom resource classes provide the commerce-shaped endpoints — a `current-store` resource, cart and checkout resources, and shims (`EntityResourceShim`) over core JSON:API — and `Routing\Routes` plus `WishlistIntegrationRoutes` register them under the `%jsonapi%` prefix. The interesting piece is session handling: `CartTokenSession` **decorates** `commerce_cart.cart_session` so that when a request carries the `Commerce-Cart-Token` header the cart ids come from a shared tempstore keyed by that token instead of the PHP session, and `CartTokenSessionConfiguration` decorates `session_configuration` so such requests are treated as having a session at all. A `CartTokenSubscriber` additionally adopts carts from a `?cartToken=` **query parameter** at request time — convenient for handing a cart from a JS app to Drupal's own checkout, and the reason for the note in `security.md` at this module's root. Supporting pieces include an `EntityUuidConverter` param converter (UUIDs instead of ids in paths), field access control (`FieldAccess`), normalizers for addresses and shipment items, a `ResourceTypeBuildSubscriber` and `CollectResourceObjectMetaSubscriber` shaping the JSON:API schema, a `ResponseVarySubscriber` adding the cart-token header to `Vary`, and webhook routes (`/webhooks/fulfillment/{order}`, `/webhooks/order/{order}/{transition}`) that apply an order state transition, gated by `commerce_order.update` entity access.
