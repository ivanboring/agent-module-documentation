# Commerce Omise — manual setup guide

**Commerce Omise** (`commerce_omise`) integrates the **Omise** payment gateway —
widely used in **Thailand and Japan** — with Drupal Commerce. The shopper pays via
Omise, and Omise posts a webhook event back to your store to report the outcome. It
depends only on Commerce **Payment** (`commerce_payment`).

The problem it solves is accepting Omise card payments in a Commerce store. You add
a Commerce payment gateway of type **Omise**, enter your Omise API credentials, and
choose test or live mode.

> **Important security caveat — read before using in production.** As shipped in
> this development version, the Omise webhook is **not verified**. The module marks a
> payment *completed* based on the status in the incoming webhook body, with no
> signature check and without re-fetching the charge from Omise's API to confirm it.
> That means someone who knows a charge id could POST a forged "successful"
> notification and have an order fulfilled **without actually paying**. Do **not**
> run this in production as-is. See the security note in
> [Configuration](configuration/index.md) for what to require before going live.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer and enable the
   module.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — add the Omise payment gateway, enter
   your credentials, and read the webhook security caveat.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

Omise is a payment gateway, so you set it up under **Commerce → Configuration →
Payment gateways** (`/admin/commerce/config/payment-gateways`) → **Add payment
gateway** → choose the **Omise** plugin.
