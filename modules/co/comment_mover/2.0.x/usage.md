Comment Mover lets administrators relocate comments (and their reply threads) from one node to another using a clipboard metaphor, and convert between nodes and comments.

---

A `CommentMoverController` exposes `/comment_mover/cut/{entity_type}/{entity_id}` and `/comment_mover/paste/{entity_type}/{entity_id}`, both requiring the core `administer comments` permission. "Cut" stores the selected entity on the private tempstore clipboard (`comment_mover.clipboard`), "paste" re-parents the clipboard's comments under the target entity via the `comment_mover.mover` service, invalidating cache tags. A `CommentMoverBlock` provides the clipboard UI/form. The module can also convert a node into a comment and vice-versa (`CutEntity`, `CommentMover`).

Security notes to be aware of: the cut/paste routes are state-changing GET requests with no CSRF token, and both redirect to a caller-supplied `?destination` without validation (`new RedirectResponse($request->get('destination'))`) — an open-redirect / CSRF consideration, though both are gated behind the sensitive `administer comments` permission.
