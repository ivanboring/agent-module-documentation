Commerce PayUMoney integrates the PayU / PayUMoney hosted checkout (popular in India) with Drupal Commerce as an offsite redirect gateway. Shoppers are sent to PayU to pay, and PayU calls back to the site's notify/success/failure endpoints to report the outcome.

---

Install with Composer (`drupal/commerce_payumoney`) and enable it (depends on commerce and commerce_payment). Create a PayUMoney payment gateway from the payment gateways collection (/admin/commerce/config/payment-gateways) and enter your merchant key and salt. PayU posts results to /payment/notify/payumoney, /payment/success/payumoney and /payment/failure/payumoney. IMPORTANT: review the callback signature verification before production use (see the agent notes) -- the shipped verifyPaymentHash() does not implement a real hash check.
