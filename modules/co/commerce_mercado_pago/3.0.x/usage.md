Commerce Mercado Pago implements Mercado Pago on the site.

---

Commerce Mercado Pago **provides the Mercado Pago payment gateway** for Drupal Commerce — the customer pays via
Mercado Pago (Checkout Pro / popup), and the module records the payment. It depends on Commerce Payment.

Use it to accept Mercado Pago payments (Latin America). It is a **payment gateway**, and its result handling is
sound: the `onReturn()` handler **verifies the payment with the Mercado Pago API before trusting the return query
parameters** (its own comment notes this "prevents" trusting client-supplied status), and it also implements an
`onNotify()` IPN webhook — so the payment outcome is derived from Mercado Pago's authenticated API, not from
forgeable request data. Security essentials: store the Mercado Pago **access token/credentials as secrets**
(env/Key), serve over HTTPS, and (for the IPN webhook) confirm it likewise validates against the MP API. It has no
access-control role. Configure the Mercado Pago credentials.
