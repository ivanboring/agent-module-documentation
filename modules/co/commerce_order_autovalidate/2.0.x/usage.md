Commerce Order Auto-validation automatically transitions Drupal Commerce orders to the validated state once they are paid in full, checked on cron.

---

Commerce Order Auto-validation automatically transitions Drupal Commerce orders in the `validation`
state to `validated` once they are **paid in full** — a cron job finds orders in validation state with a
completed payment and applies the `validate` transition, but only after confirming the order is actually
paid. It depends on Commerce Order.

This is correctly guarded: before applying the transition, it checks `$order->isPaid()` (Commerce's method
that verifies total paid covers the order total), so an order is only auto-validated when it is genuinely
paid in full — it does not validate unpaid orders. Use it to automate order validation on paid orders
(reducing manual validation). It is an e-commerce/order-workflow feature; the auto-validation is
payment-gated. Ensure your order workflow includes a `validation` state and `validate` transition.
