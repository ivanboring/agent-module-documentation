Config Ignore Webform ignores webform config on config import (except templates/exclusions).

---

Config Ignore Webform **excludes webforms from config sync** — configuring Config Ignore to ignore webform and
webform-options configuration (except templates and configured exclusions), so site-editors' webforms aren't
overwritten on config import. It depends on the Config Ignore and Webform modules.

Use it to protect editor-managed webforms from deployment overwrites. It is a configuration-management feature; it
changes what config sync manages and has no content or access role. Note: ignored config isn't tracked in
version control — accept that trade-off for the editor-managed forms. Configure the ignore patterns.
