# Configuration

Configuration has two layers: **global defaults** that apply everywhere unless
overridden, and **per‑variation settings** on each bookable product. There's also
an optional Twilio SMS section and an admin report.

## Global booking defaults

1. Log in as a user with `administer commerce appointment scheduler`.
2. Go to **Configuration → Services → Commerce Appointment Scheduler**
   (`/admin/config/services/commerce-appointment-scheduler`).

Here you set the store‑wide defaults that a variation inherits unless it defines its
own:

- **Default business timezone** — the timezone appointments are scheduled in.
- **Default weekly schedule (JSON)** — the seven‑day availability template.
- **Default blackout dates** — dates to exclude, including specific dates
  (e.g. `2026-07-04`) and recurring annual dates (e.g. `12-25`).
- **Default appointment duration** — the standard slot length (the module's default
  workflow is one hour).
- **Default slot capacity** — how many bookings a single slot allows.
- **Default lead time** — how far in advance a customer must book.
- **Default booking window** — how far into the future customers may book.
- **Default buffer between slots** — gap enforced between appointments.
- **Optional Twilio SMS notification settings** — enable and configure store SMS
  notifications (reference the Twilio credentials you stored as secrets during
  [Installation](../installation/index.md)).

Save the form.

## Per-variation appointment settings

On an individual Commerce **product variation**, enable appointment scheduling and
either accept the global defaults or override any of them for that product:
duration, capacity, lead time, booking window, buffer, timezone, location, and the
weekly schedule, plus its own blackout dates. There's also an optional appointment
**image** field for the variation.

Because settings are per‑variation, you can run different services with completely
different availability from the same store.

## How booking works on the storefront

An appointment‑enabled product shows an interactive calendar in the add‑to‑cart
form. The customer clicks an available date, picks a start time, optionally adds
details, and adds it to the cart. On submission the module **validates the slot on
the server**, checking capacity against existing non‑draft, non‑cancelled Commerce
orders, so a slot can't be overbooked. The chosen appointment (start, end,
timezone, location, notes) is stored on the order item, and different appointments
stay as separate cart lines rather than merging. A non‑JavaScript fallback uses the
underlying Commerce select element.

## Bookings report

Review upcoming booked appointments at **Reports → Commerce appointments**
(`/admin/reports/commerce-appointments`). Viewing it requires the `view commerce
appointment bookings` permission.

## Test it

Enable appointments on a variation, set a small weekly schedule, then book a slot on
the storefront. Confirm the slot's capacity is respected (try to overbook it) and
that the appointment details appear on the order item and in the bookings report.
