Commerce Merchant Warrior provides Merchant Warrior integration for Drupal Commerce.

---

Commerce Merchant Warrior **provides the Merchant Warrior payment gateway** for Drupal Commerce — processing
card payments via Merchant Warrior's Payframe (tokenized card capture) and Direct API. It depends on Commerce,
Commerce Payment and core REST.

Use it to accept Merchant Warrior card payments. It is a **payment gateway** with a server-to-server (Direct API)
design, and its verification is sound: outbound API requests are **signed with HMAC-SHA256 over the query string
using the API passphrase** (`hash_hmac('sha256', $query_string, $api_passphrase)`), and payment methods/cards are
**verified server-side via the Direct API `verifyCard` call** rather than trusting client-supplied status — so
payment outcomes come from authenticated API responses, not a forgeable browser callback. Security essentials:
store the Merchant Warrior **merchant UUID / API key / passphrase as secrets** (env/Key), serve over HTTPS, and
(with Payframe) card data is tokenized so raw PAN doesn't hit your server. It has no access-control role.
