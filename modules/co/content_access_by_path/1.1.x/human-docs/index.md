# Content Access by Path — manual setup guide

**Content Access by Path** (`content_access_by_path`) aims to confine an editor to
the parts of a site whose **URL aliases begin with a configured path** — so a news
team can edit everything under `/news/…` and nothing else. It depends on core's
Field and Taxonomy modules, and ships an optional submodule
(`content_access_by_path_admin_content`).

The idea is a genuinely useful one. Delegating editing "by section" is a common need
on large sites, and core has no native answer: permissions are per content type and
per ownership, neither of which expresses "this team owns this branch of the site".
Content Access by Path keys on the path alias — which already mirrors the site's
structure — and, importantly, enforces its decisions through Drupal's **real access
layer** (`hook_node_access()` and `hook_entity_field_access()`), so they apply to
JSON:API, REST, and Views, not just the rendered page. An editor's allowed sections
are driven by a taxonomy field on their user account.

**Please read this before deploying it as a security boundary.** The publicly
documented analysis of version **1.1.3** found three defects — verified on a clean
install — that make this release **unsafe to rely on as a restriction**:

1. **Restricting an editor can accidentally *widen* their access.** The
   "own content" escape hatch returns an *allowed* access result instead of a
   *neutral* one. Because an allowed result from `hook_node_access()` is OR‑ed with
   core's decision, **populating a user's restriction field can grant update and
   delete on that user's own nodes even to someone who holds no edit or delete
   permission at all** — and the configured section isn't even consulted. The very
   act of restricting an editor is what can broaden them.
2. **Section matching is a bare prefix check.** It uses an unbounded "starts with"
   test, so a section of `/news` **also matches** `/newsletter-admin` or
   `/news-archive-private` — paths you never intended to include.
3. **Access is keyed on the URL alias, which is content.** Renaming an alias moves a
   node between sections, and anyone who can set an alias can move their own content
   into a section they're allowed to edit.

In short: treat this module as a **convenience for organising editorial work, not a
hard security boundary**, until these issues are resolved upstream. This project is
covered by Drupal's security advisory policy — check the project page for a fixed
release before using it to protect anything sensitive.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer, enable the module,
   and (optionally) its admin‑content submodule.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — set up the sections and assign editors,
   plus what the module does and does not protect.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

The module provides a settings form (route `content_access_by_path.settings`) under
the site's **Configuration** area, gated by the **"Administer content access by
path"** permission. Per‑editor section assignments are made through a **taxonomy
field on the user account**. See [Configuration](configuration/index.md).
