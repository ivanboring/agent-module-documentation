Convert Media Tags to Markup fixes legacy Drupal 7 `media_wysiwyg` embed tokens (the `[[{"type":"media",...,"fid":"123",...}]]` JSON blobs left behind after a migration) by turning them into real `<img>` markup, either on the fly with a text-format filter or permanently in the database via a Drush-run helper.

---

The module provides one text filter plugin, `convert_legacy_media_tags_to_markup`
("Convert Legacy Media Tags to Markup", `TYPE_TRANSFORM_IRREVERSIBLE`), which you add to a
text format; on render it calls `App::filterText()`. That method regex-matches media tokens
(`/\[\[\{.*?"type":"media".+?\}\]\]/s`), JSON-decodes each, loads the referenced file by
`fid` (`File::load`), builds an absolute-then-relative file URL, and emits a fixed
`<div class="media …"><img …></div>` block using the token's `alt`, `title`, `class`,
`style`, `height`, and `width` attributes. A failed token (bad JSON, missing `fid`, unloadable
file) is logged to watchdog and replaced with an empty string (the filter as a whole falls back
to the original text on a top-level exception). For a one-time permanent conversion, the
`DbReplacer` singleton (`\Drupal\convert_media_tags_to_markup\ConvertMediaTagsToMarkup\DbReplacer::instance()->replaceAll($entity_type, $bundle, $simulate)`,
invoked via `drush ev`) loads every entity of a type/bundle, runs each formatted-text field
value through the same `filterText()`, and either prints a simulation (when `$simulate = TRUE`)
or saves the rewritten value (when `FALSE`). There is no admin UI, permission, config schema,
plugin type, or registered Drush command — it is a filter plus a code entry point. The emitted
`<img>` interpolates the token's attribute values into HTML without escaping, so the filter's
output is only as trustworthy as the users who can author content in the formats it is enabled
on — see the XSS note in `agent/configure/filter.md`.

- Render legacy D7 `media_wysiwyg` embed tokens as images without re-importing content.
- Add a text-format filter that converts `[[{"type":"media",...}]]` blobs to `<img>` on output.
- Clean up body fields after a Drupal 7 → 10/11 migration that left raw media JSON.
- Permanently rewrite media tokens to markup in the database with a Drush one-liner.
- Preview a bulk conversion in simulation mode before writing changes.
- Convert media tokens for a single entity type and bundle at a time (e.g. `node`/`page`).
- Restore broken images on migrated nodes where the Media module is no longer used.
- Keep the referenced file entity (by `fid`) as the image source during conversion.
- Preserve original `alt`, `title`, `class`, `style`, `width`, and `height` from the token.
- Fall back gracefully (empty image / original text) when a token's file is missing.
- Log conversion failures to watchdog for post-migration auditing.
- Batch-fix an entire content type's legacy embeds ahead of decommissioning old media handling.
- Apply the fix only on selected text formats (e.g. Full HTML) via the filter.
- Combine with revision creation so a bad bulk conversion can be reverted per node.
- Avoid maintaining the D7 Media module purely to display old embeds.
- Migrate embed markup once, then remove the runtime filter for performance.
- Handle multiple media tokens within a single field value in one pass.
- Produce consistent, theme-independent `<div class="media …">` image wrappers.
- Support Drupal 10 and 11 on PHP 8.
- Transform content during a staged content-cleanup project without editor effort.
