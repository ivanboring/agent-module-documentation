# Convert Media Tags to Markup — manual setup guide

**Convert Media Tags to Markup** (`convert_media_tags_to_markup`) cleans up the
leftover media embed tokens that a Drupal 7 → 10/11 migration tends to strand in
your body fields. In Drupal 7 the *Media* module stored embeds as JSON blobs like
`[[{"type":"media","fid":"123",...}]]`. After migrating, those blobs sit in the
text unrendered, so images appear as raw gibberish. This module turns each token
back into a real `<img>` tag pointing at the referenced file.

You can apply the fix in two ways. The **text filter** ("Convert Legacy Media Tags
to Markup") rewrites the tokens on the way out, every time the content is rendered —
add it to a text format and you are done, no re-import needed. Alternatively, a
one-time **database conversion** (run through Drush) rewrites the stored field
values permanently, so you can then remove the runtime filter entirely. The
permanent path has a simulate mode so you can preview every change before committing
it.

The module is intentionally tiny: no admin settings page, no permissions, no
config schema, and no dependencies beyond Drupal core's `file` and `filter`. For
each token it loads the file by its `fid`, builds the image URL, and emits a fixed
`<div class="media …"><img …></div>` wrapper carrying the original `alt`, `title`,
`class`, `style`, `width`, and `height`. A token whose file is missing is logged and
dropped rather than left broken.

**One important caveat.** The image markup is assembled by string concatenation and
the token's attribute values are **not** escaped, so a crafted `alt`/`style`/etc.
could inject markup. In practice the token content is authored or migrated content,
so the filter is only as safe as the people who can write in the formats it is
enabled on. Enable it only on formats restricted to trusted roles, keep a **"Limit
allowed HTML tags"** filter on the same format (ordered to run *after* this
transform), and prefer the one-time database conversion so untrusted input is never
passed through it live.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token-cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install the module with Composer and
   enable it.

## How to use it

There is no admin menu item and no settings form. You use the module in one of two
ways.

### Option A — the runtime text filter

1. Go to **Configuration → Content authoring → Text formats and editors**
   (`/admin/config/content/formats`) and edit a format such as *Full HTML*
   (`/admin/config/content/formats/manage/full_html`).
2. Tick **"Convert Legacy Media Tags to Markup"** and save.
3. Any content in that format now renders its old media tokens as images.

The filter has no settings of its own. Because it is an *irreversible transform*
(it rewrites output and cannot undo it), order it sensibly relative to your other
filters — and keep a **"Limit allowed HTML tags and correct faulty HTML"** filter
running after it to sanitize the result.

### Option B — permanent one-time conversion (Drush)

The module registers no Drush command; instead it exposes a code entry point you
invoke with `drush ev`. **Back up your database first**, and enable *Create new
revision* on the bundle so you can revert per node.

Always simulate first (the trailing `TRUE` prints intended changes and saves
nothing):

```bash
drush ev "\Drupal\convert_media_tags_to_markup\ConvertMediaTagsToMarkup\DbReplacer::instance()->replaceAll('node', 'page', TRUE);"
```

Review the output, then run it for real (trailing `FALSE` saves the entities):

```bash
drush ev "\Drupal\convert_media_tags_to_markup\ConvertMediaTagsToMarkup\DbReplacer::instance()->replaceAll('node', 'page', FALSE);"
```

The signature is `replaceAll(string $type, string $bundle, bool $simulate = TRUE)`.
It loads every entity of that type and bundle, runs each formatted long-text field
value through the same conversion, and either prints the would-be result (simulate)
or saves it (live). Errors are logged per entity. Once conversion is done you can
turn the runtime filter off and remove the module.

> **Using DDEV?** Prefix Drush with `ddev` when running from your host machine —
> `ddev drush ev "…"`.

The same XSS caveat noted above applies to the saved markup, since the original
token attribute values are interpolated unescaped into the stored HTML too.
