CoinsPaid Commerce adds a CoinsPaid crypto off-site gateway with signature-verified callbacks.

---

CoinsPaid Commerce (module `commerce_coinspaid`, project `coinspaid`) is a Drupal Commerce off-site payment gateway for CoinsPaid — letting customers pay in cryptocurrency by redirecting to CoinsPaid and completing the order on callback.

Security: the callback (`onNotify`) verifies an **HMAC-SHA512 signature** (`X-Processing-Signature`) of the callback body against the configured secret key and throws on mismatch (no payment on an invalid signature), and it records the payment using the **order's own total** rather than a callback-supplied amount — the correct, defensive pattern. Store the public/secret keys securely (env-backed). Depends on `commerce_payment`; supports Drupal 10 and 11.
