# Content Feedback — manual setup guide

**Content Feedback** (`content_feedback`) gives your visitors and users a quick way
to send feedback about the page they're looking at, and gives your team a tidy
place to review it. It's aimed at content quality assurance: readers can flag that
a page is unhelpful, report a problem, or suggest an improvement, and site admins
work through those reports afterwards.

You choose which content types show the feedback form, and only users with the
right permission can see and submit it. The form is submitted over **AJAX**, so a
visitor can send feedback without leaving the page they're reading. On the admin
side, every submission is collected into an administrative list, grouped by status,
where an admin can review each item and mark it **Resolved**.

The module works once enabled, but you need to visit its settings form to pick the
content types it applies to and to hand out the relevant permissions, so treat it
as a **needs‑config** module. It has no dependencies beyond Drupal core.

A word on safety, because feedback is **user‑submitted input**: display it to
admins with the usual care against stored cross‑site scripting, consider spam if
you expose the form to anonymous visitors (pairing it with flood control or a
CAPTCHA is wise), and remember submissions may contain personal data. The module's
permission controls who can *view* collected feedback — it grants no other access
to your content.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install the module with Composer and
   enable it.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — choose which content types get the
   form, set permissions, and manage the feedback list.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

Content Feedback's settings form is the `content_feedback.settings` route. If you
can't recall the exact path, open the **Extend** page (`/admin/modules`), find
Content Feedback in the list, and click its **Configure** link to jump straight to
the settings form. The collected feedback is reviewed from the module's
administrative feedback list, where entries are grouped by status.
