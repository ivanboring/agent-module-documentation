# Installation

## Requirements

- **Drupal 9, 10, or 11** (`core_version_requirement: ^9 || ^10 || ^11`).
- **Commerce Order** (`commerce_order`) — the module provides a Commerce inline form
  and integrates with the checkout/profile flow.
- For the optional submodules: **Commerce Shipping** and/or **Commerce Payment**,
  respectively, since those panes extend those integrations.

There are no third‑party Composer or PHP library requirements. This release is a
beta, so try it on a non-production copy first.

## Install with Composer

From the project root:

```bash
composer require drupal/commerce_profile_inline_form_radios -W
```

The `-W` (`--with-all-dependencies`) flag lets Composer update any shared
dependencies as needed.

> **Using DDEV?** Prefix Composer and Drush with `ddev` when you run from your host
> machine — `ddev composer require drupal/commerce_profile_inline_form_radios -W`,
> `ddev drush …`. Inside the container (`ddev ssh`) run them without the prefix.

## Enable the module

```bash
drush en commerce_profile_inline_form_radios -y
```

## Submodules

The project ships two optional submodules that reuse the parent module's inline form
to provide alternative checkout panes. Enable only the ones matching your checkout
integrations:

| Submodule | Provides |
|-----------|----------|
| **Shipping** | An alternative Commerce Shipping checkout pane built on the radio-button inline form. Requires Commerce Shipping. |
| **Payment** | An alternative Commerce Payment checkout pane built on the radio-button inline form. Requires Commerce Payment. |

Enable one with `drush en`, for example:

```bash
drush en commerce_profile_inline_form_radios_shipping -y
```

(Check the module's own `.info.yml` files for the exact submodule machine names in
your copy before enabling.)

## Verify it worked

As a returning customer with more than one saved profile, go through checkout. Where
the profile is collected you should see your saved profiles presented as radio
buttons, letting you pick one instead of re-typing an address. If you enabled a
shipping or payment submodule, confirm its pane appears in your checkout flow.
