# Contact Optional Outgoing Mail — manual setup guide

**Contact Optional Outgoing Mail** (`contact_optional_outgoing_mail`) makes the
**recipient** field on a contact form optional. Normally Drupal's Contact module
insists on at least one recipient email address when you create or edit a contact
form, and it emails that address on every submission. This module relaxes that
requirement, so a form can be saved and used without a recipient — in which case no
email is sent on submission.

The problem it solves shows up when you only want to **store** contact submissions
rather than email them. Paired with the Contact Storage module, for example, you
can collect submissions in the database and skip the outgoing notification
entirely. It's a small, focused contact-form tweak that depends only on core's
**Contact** module and supports Drupal 9, 10, and 11.

There's no central settings page. Once enabled, the recipient field simply becomes
optional on the contact-form edit screen — leave it empty for the forms that
shouldn't send mail, as described below. The module also provides its own
permission, so you can review it at the permissions page.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install the module with Composer and
   enable it.

There is **no central configuration page** — enabling the module simply makes the
recipient field optional on contact forms, as described below.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

The module adds no settings page of its own. You work on each contact form at
**Structure → Contact forms → *(your form)* → Edit** (`/admin/structure/contact`),
where the **Recipients** field is now optional. Its permission (if you need to
review it) is at **People → Permissions** (`/admin/people/permissions`).

## How to use it

1. Enable the module (see [Installation](installation/index.md)).
2. Go to **Structure → Contact forms** (`/admin/structure/contact`) and edit the
   form that should not send email.
3. Leave the **Recipients** field **empty** and save. Core would previously have
   blocked this; now it's allowed.
4. With no recipient set, submissions to that form are **not** emailed. If you're
   using Contact Storage (or another handler), the submissions are still captured
   there.

For forms where you *do* want notifications, just fill in the recipient as usual —
the field is optional, not removed.
