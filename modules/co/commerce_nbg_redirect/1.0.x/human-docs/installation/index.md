# Installation

## Requirements

- **Drupal 11** (`core_version_requirement: ^11`).
- Drupal Commerce with **Payment** (`commerce_payment`) enabled — the only module
  dependency, enabled automatically.
- An **NBG / GlobalPayments merchant account** with the credentials for the hosted
  payment page. Google Pay and Apple Pay need to be activated and tested with your
  merchant account separately.

There are no additional third‑party Composer or PHP library requirements.

## Install with Composer

From the project root:

```bash
composer require drupal/commerce_nbg_redirect -W
```

The `-W` (`--with-all-dependencies`) flag lets Composer update any shared
dependencies as needed.

> **Using DDEV?** Prefix Composer and Drush with `ddev` when you run from your host
> machine — `ddev composer require drupal/commerce_nbg_redirect -W`, `ddev drush …`.
> Inside the container (`ddev ssh`) run them without the prefix.

## Enable the module

```bash
drush en commerce_nbg_redirect -y
```

Commerce Payment is enabled automatically as a dependency.

## Verify it worked

Go to **Commerce → Configuration → Payment gateways → Add payment gateway**
(`/admin/commerce/config/payment-gateways/add`). The plugin list should now include
**National Bank of Greece (Redirect)**. Configuring it is covered in
[Configuration](../configuration/index.md).
