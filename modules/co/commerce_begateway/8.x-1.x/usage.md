BeGateway Payment adds a BeGateway off-site gateway whose notifications are authenticated.

---

BeGateway Payment implements the BeGateway payment gateway for Commerce (off-site redirect) — the shopper is redirected to BeGateway to pay and the order is completed on return/notification.

Security: the notify handler (`onNotify`) uses the BeGateway SDK `Webhook` and checks `$webhook->isAuthorized()` (shop-id/secret credential verification) before acting, and the return path compares the gateway transaction amount to the order's amount — it does not blindly trust the callback. Store the shop key/secret securely (env-backed). Depends on `commerce_payment` and `token`; supports Drupal 9, 10, and 11.
