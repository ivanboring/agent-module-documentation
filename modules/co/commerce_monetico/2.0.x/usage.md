Commerce Monetico creates an interface between Drupal Commerce and the Monetico payment kit (Cybermut / CIC).

---

Commerce Monetico integrates Drupal Commerce with the Monetico payment kit (Cybermut / CIC / Crédit
Mutuel) — providing a payment gateway that redirects the customer to Monetico for payment and processes the
return/notification. It depends on Commerce Payment, in the Commerce (contrib) package.

Security handling is correct: the callback controller (`CommerceMoneticoRoutingController::response()`)
**verifies the Monetico HMAC-SHA1 seal** — it recomputes the MAC over the returned fields
(`MoneticoHmac::computeHmac`) and only marks the payment success/failure and applies the order "place"
transition **inside** the `computeHmac(...) == posted MAC` check; a mismatching MAC returns MAC-NOT-OK and
does not process the payment. So the public callback route (`/commerce_monetico/response`) is safe because
forged callbacks fail the HMAC check. When adopting: store the Monetico **security key** (and TPE number) as
secrets, operate over HTTPS, and keep the merchant key confidential (the HMAC's security rests on it). One
minor hardening note: the MAC comparison uses `==` rather than `hash_equals()` (non-constant-time; a
practical timing/forgery attack is infeasible since the compared value is secret-key-derived). Configure the
Monetico credentials.
