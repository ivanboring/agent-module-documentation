# Installation

## Requirements

- **Drupal 10.1, 11 (or newer)** (`core_version_requirement: ^10.1||^11`).
- **Drupal Commerce** (`commerce`) — this is the only module dependency.

There are no extra PHP or third‑party library requirements.

## Install with Composer

From the project root:

```bash
composer require drupal/commerce_addtocart_ajax -W
```

The `-W` (`--with-all-dependencies`) flag lets Composer update shared dependencies
as needed.

> **Using DDEV?** Prefix Composer and Drush with `ddev` when you run from your
> host machine — `ddev composer require drupal/commerce_addtocart_ajax -W`,
> `ddev drush …`. Inside the container (`ddev ssh`) run them without the prefix.

## Enable the module

```bash
drush en commerce_addtocart_ajax -y
```

Once enabled, the add‑to‑cart form submits over AJAX. If your theme's messages
container is not the default `.status-messages`, set the correct selector — see
[Configuration](../configuration/index.md).

## Verify it worked

On your storefront, add a product to the cart. The page should **not** reload — you
should see a brief loading animation, a status message appear in your theme's
messages area, and the cart block update with the new item. If the status message
doesn't show, adjust the selector on the settings form.
