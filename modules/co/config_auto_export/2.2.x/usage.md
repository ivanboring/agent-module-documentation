Config Auto Export watches for configuration changes, writes them to a directory as they happen, and can call a webhook so something downstream — usually a CI pipeline — reacts.

---

Drupal's configuration workflow assumes discipline: change something in the UI, remember to run `drush config:export`, commit the result. The failure mode is universal and quiet — someone adjusts a view or a field on production or on a shared development site, nobody exports, and weeks later a deployment overwrites the change or a diff appears that nobody can explain. This closes the loop by exporting automatically on change, so the files always reflect the site, and by optionally firing a **webhook** so a pipeline can commit them, open a merge request or simply notify a channel. Version **2.2.2** on core `^10.3 || ^11`, settings behind `administer site configuration`, with a separate `trigger config_auto_export` permission — `restrict access: true` — for firing the webhook by hand. Three things to settle before turning it on. **The export directory must not be web-accessible**: exported configuration contains a great deal a site should not publish, and while sensitive values belong in a Key or an environment variable rather than in config, real sites have API endpoints, internal paths and email addresses in there. **The webhook URL is a credential** — anything holding it can trigger the pipeline — so it belongs in an environment variable, not in exported configuration where this very module would write it. And **automatic export changes what a config diff means**: a diff is no longer a record of deliberate change but of every change including accidental ones, so the review step moves from "export" to "commit", and someone has to be doing it.
