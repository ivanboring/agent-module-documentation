# Commerce Unzer — manual setup guide

**Commerce Unzer** (`commerce_unzer`) provides a payment gateway for the **Unzer**
provider (formerly Heidelpay) in Drupal Commerce. The customer pays through Unzer
and the module records the resulting payment against the order. It began life as a
port of the older `commerce_heidelpay` module to Unzer's current SDK.

There are two flavours: an **on‑site** gateway that supports credit‑card payment
(a straightforward port from Heidelpay), and an **off‑site** redirect gateway
under active development that is intended to support additional payment methods
beyond cards. It depends on **Commerce Payment** and is configured as a standard
Commerce payment gateway.

**On the security of payment confirmation (good news):** the module does not trust
the browser for the payment result. Its `onReturn()` handler **re‑fetches the
payment from the Unzer API server‑side** (`fetchPayment()`) to determine the
outcome, and it also implements `onNotify()` for Unzer webhooks — so the payment
status always comes from Unzer's authenticated API, never from forgeable request
parameters. Your part is to keep the Unzer **private and public keys** as secrets
and to serve the site over HTTPS.

One important environment note: Unzer's SDK can throw rounding‑error exceptions for
some amounts unless PHP's `serialize_precision` is set to `-1`. Set that in your PHP
configuration before going live (details in [Installation](installation/index.md)).

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer, set
   `serialize_precision`, and enable the module.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — add the Unzer payment gateway and
   enter your keys securely.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

Unzer is added under **Commerce → Configuration → Payment gateways**
(`/admin/commerce/config/payment-gateways`). See
[Configuration](configuration/index.md).
