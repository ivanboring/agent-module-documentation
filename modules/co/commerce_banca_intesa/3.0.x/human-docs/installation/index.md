# Installation

## Requirements

- **Drupal 10 or 11** (`core_version_requirement: ^10 || ^11`).
- **Drupal Commerce** with its **Order** and **Payment** modules enabled
  (`commerce_order`, `commerce_payment`). Drupal enables these dependencies for
  you when you turn on this module.
- A **Banca Intesa Serbia (NestPay/Payten) merchant account** — you'll need your
  merchant ID and the shared **store key** the bank issues.

There are no third‑party Composer or PHP library requirements.

## Install with Composer

From the project root:

```bash
composer require drupal/commerce_banca_intesa -W
```

The `-W` (`--with-all-dependencies`) flag lets Composer update any shared
dependencies as needed.

> **Using DDEV?** Prefix Composer and Drush with `ddev` when you run from your
> host machine — `ddev composer require drupal/commerce_banca_intesa -W`,
> `ddev drush …`. Inside the container (`ddev ssh`) run them without the prefix.

## Enable the module

```bash
drush en commerce_banca_intesa -y
```

## Verify it worked

Go to **Administration → Commerce → Configuration → Payment gateways**. Click
**Add payment gateway** and confirm that **Banca Intesa** appears in the list of
plugins. From there, continue to [Configuration](../configuration/index.md) to
enter your credentials.
