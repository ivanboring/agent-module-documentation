Greeting Cards lets a visitor build an e-card: they upload images or PDFs on a form, the module merges/renders them into a PDF (mPDF), generates a first-page thumbnail (ImageMagick `convert`), creates a `greeting_cards` node, and then e-mails a link to a recipient address entered on the form.

---

The flow spans an `EcardForm` (`/greeting-cards/e-cards`) that collects a title, sender name/relation/occasion, uploaded files, a recipient e-mail and a category term; a `SendCardsFriends` controller that lists the created cards, sends the mail and shows a single card's details; and a `GreetingCardLayOut` controller that renders a printable/searchable gallery grouped by taxonomy category. PDFs are produced by `Plugin\PdfCreation` (mpdf/mpdf) and thumbnails by `greeting_cards_convert_pdf_to_image()` shelling out to ImageMagick `convert`. Sender details and the recipient e-mail are carried in `$_SESSION`, and the outgoing mail (`hook_mail` key `greeting_cards_e_card`, HTML) embeds the sender name/relation/occasion, card image and link.

Operationally note that **all six routes are gated only by `access content`** (effectively anonymous on a default site), yet the form creates nodes (`nodeStorage->create()`), sends e-mail to a user-supplied address, and the card-detail/gallery controllers load nodes by id without an entity-access or bundle check. Requirements: the `convert` binary and the `mpdf/mpdf` library must be available, plus a `greeting_cards` content type with `field_pdf`, `field_thumbnail_image` and `field_category`, and a `card_categories` taxonomy vocabulary. Typical setup: install mPDF + ImageMagick, add the content type and vocabulary, then restrict the routes' permission if you do not want anonymous card creation/e-mailing.
