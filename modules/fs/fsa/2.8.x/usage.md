Fastly Streamline Access adds a user's IP address to a Fastly ACL when they authenticate, so a site protected at the CDN by an IP allow-list can be reached by staff without a VPN or a manual allow-list update.

---

The pattern belongs to hosting platforms — Lagoon in particular, which the permission name reflects — where a non-production environment is shielded at the edge: Fastly holds an ACL of permitted addresses and rejects everything else before the request reaches Drupal. That protects the environment well and makes it awkward to use, because every new location means someone editing an ACL by hand. This module closes the loop: a user with `access protected lagoon routes` authenticates, an event fires, and their address is added to the configured ACL through the Fastly API, with `FsaFastly` and `FsaComms` handling the calls and `FsaEventSubscriber` the trigger. The **project is `fsa` and the module is `fastly_streamline_access`**, so `drush en fsa` fails. Before deploying it, note that this campaign found the address it adds is read from a **client-supplied `Fastly-Client-IP` header** rather than through Drupal's trusted-proxy handling — verified — which means a permitted user can add an address other than their own to the ACL. The local security notes give the detail and the fix.
