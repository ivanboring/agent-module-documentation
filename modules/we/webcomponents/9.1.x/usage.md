Web components integrates the LRN/HAX web-components build with Drupal so custom elements (`<x-foo>`) and their polyfills load site-wide.

---

Via `hook_page_attachments_alter()` it injects preconnect/preload/modulepreload link tags for the build assets (build.js, wc-registry.json, the wc-autoload and dynamic-import-registry ES6 modules) from a configurable project location, and `hook_page_bottom()` appends a small inline `<script>` that sets `window.__appCDN` and loads `build.js`. The asset location is set on the admin form at `/admin/config/content/webcomponents` (permission `administer site configuration`); it can point at a local library path or a CDN, and can optionally serve the build file locally while pulling assets from a CDN.

Operationally the only privileged surface is the admin settings form. Note the bottom-of-page markup is emitted with Twig `{{ somecontent|raw }}` and the CDN/location value is interpolated unescaped into a `<script>` tag — but that value comes only from `administer site configuration`, a trusted admin permission.
