# Webform Submission Files Download

Adds a **Files download** operation to each webform submission that gathers every managed
file uploaded through that submission's file elements, zips them, and streams the archive
back to the browser. Access is controlled by a single dedicated permission,
**download any webform submission managed files** (`restrict access: TRUE`). Requires the
`pclzip/pclzip` library.

---

## Summary

`hook_entity_operation()` adds a `files_download` operation linking to route
`entity.webform_submission.files_download`
(`/admin/structure/webform/manage/{webform}/submission/{webform_submission}/files_download`),
guarded by `_permission: 'download any webform submission managed files'`. The controller
`DefaultController::download_download()` loads the webform and submission, iterates the
webform's managed-file elements (`getElementsManagedFiles()`), collects each element's file
IDs from the submission, loads the `File` entities, adds their real paths to a temporary zip
via the archiver plugin, and returns a `BinaryFileResponse` with force-download headers.

The permission is the sole access gate — it is an admin/staff-level "download **any**
submission's files" grant, not a per-owner check, and the controller does not separately
verify that `{webform_submission}` belongs to `{webform}` or apply per-submission access.
Grant it only to trusted roles.
