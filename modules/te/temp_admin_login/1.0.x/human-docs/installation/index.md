# Installation

## Requirements

- **Drupal 9, 10, or 11** (`core_version_requirement: ^9 || ^10 || ^11`).
- Core's **User** module (`user`) — this is a declared dependency and is part of
  standard Drupal, so it is already enabled.

There are no third‑party Composer or PHP library requirements.

Before you install, please read the security warning on the
[main guide](../index.md) — this version's login links grant full super‑admin access
regardless of the role you pick, so weigh that against your use case.

## Install with Composer

From the project root:

```bash
composer require drupal/temp_admin_login -W
```

The `-W` (`--with-all-dependencies`) flag lets Composer update any shared
dependencies as needed.

> **Using DDEV?** Prefix Composer and Drush with `ddev` when you run from your host
> machine — `ddev composer require drupal/temp_admin_login -W`, `ddev drush …`.
> Inside the container (`ddev ssh`) run them without the prefix.

## Enable the module

```bash
drush en temp_admin_login -y
```

## Verify it worked

Log in as a user with the **Administer site configuration** permission and go to
**Configuration → System → Generate Temporary Admin Login Link**. You should see the
form for choosing a role and expiry time and generating a link. (Remember: the
generated link logs the visitor in as super‑admin whatever role you choose.)
