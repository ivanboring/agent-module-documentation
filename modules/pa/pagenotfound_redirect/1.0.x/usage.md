Page Not Found Redirect shows visitors a meaningful, branded page when a non-existent URL or node is requested.

---

It exposes a configurable 404 controller at `/friendly-404` (`PageNotFoundController::display`, permission `access content`) that renders an admin-defined title, message and a list of link "buttons" and returns HTTP 404. The settings form (`/admin/config/system/pagenotfound-redirect`, `administer site configuration`) lets an admin edit the title/message and add label+URL rows for the buttons. A small logger service records each broken-URL hit to the `page_not_found_redirect` channel. You wire it up by setting the site's 404 page (system.site `page.404`) to `/friendly-404`.

Security-relevant note for operators: the destination links are taken only from module configuration (editable by users with `administer site configuration`), not from the request, so this is not an open-redirect / request-controlled-destination vector despite the module's purpose. However, the controller builds its output by concatenating the configured `title`, `message` and each link `url`/`label` into raw `#markup` without sanitization, so a user who can edit the settings can inject markup/script — a stored-XSS risk limited to that privileged role. Prefer trusted admins and validated URLs.
