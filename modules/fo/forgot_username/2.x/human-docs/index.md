# Forgot Username — manual setup guide

**Forgot Username** (`forgot_username`) adds a public **"forgot username" form**
for logged‑out visitors at `/user/username`. A visitor enters the email address on
their account and the module emails them their Drupal username. It's a natural
companion to Drupal's built‑in password reset — helping people who remember their
email but have forgotten which username to sign in with.

Setup is minimal: install the module and the form is available at `/user/username`
for anonymous users. There is no settings form to configure.

> **Account‑enumeration consideration — read before public use.** As shipped, the
> form gives **different responses** depending on whether the email belongs to an
> account: a known email gets "Your username has been emailed," while an unknown
> email gets a validation error, "There is no account with that email address."
> That difference lets an anonymous visitor probe email addresses to learn which
> ones are registered — useful to an attacker building a target list for phishing
> or credential stuffing. (The username itself is only ever sent to the address
> that owns it; what leaks is the *existence* of an account.) If your site should
> not let user emails be probed this way, adjust the form to return a single
> neutral message regardless of whether the account exists, and add flood/rate
> limiting — the same approach the
> [Username Enumeration Prevention](https://www.drupal.org/project/username_enumeration_prevention)
> module takes for core's forms. With that mitigation in place, Forgot Username is
> a reasonable account‑recovery convenience.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer and enable the
   module.

There is **no configuration page** for this module. Its behaviour is described in
"How to use it" below.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

The module adds no admin settings page. Its user‑facing form lives at
**`/user/username`** for logged‑out visitors.

## How to use it

1. Enable the module (see Installation).
2. Point users who have forgotten their username to **`/user/username`** — for
   example, add a link next to your login and password‑reset links.
3. A visitor enters their account email; the module emails them their username.

Before exposing this on a public site, weigh the account‑enumeration
consideration above and apply the neutral‑message + rate‑limiting mitigation if
account existence should not be probeable.
