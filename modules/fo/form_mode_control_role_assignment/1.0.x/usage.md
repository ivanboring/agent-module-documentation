Form Mode Control Role Assignment assigns a configured role to users who register via a specific user form mode.

---

Form Mode Control Role Assignment maps user form modes to roles so that a person registering through a particular user-registration form mode is automatically granted a chosen role. It pairs with the Form Mode Control module's ability to expose alternate registration forms.

An admin form at `/admin/config/people/form-mode-role-mapping` (`administer site configuration`) lists every user form mode and lets an admin pick a role for each, stored in `form_mode_control_role_assignment.settings:role_mappings`. At registration the module reads the active form mode from the request `display` query parameter (`hook_form_user_register_form_alter` hides the roles checkboxes and pre-selects the mapped role) and enforces the grant in `hook_user_presave` by calling `$account->addRole()`. An event subscriber additionally adds the role on the `USER_REGISTER` event using the routed `form_mode` parameter.

Setup: enable Form Mode Control, create user form modes, map each to a role here, then link people to `/user/register?display=<form_mode>`. Because the applied role is driven by the attacker-controllable `display` query parameter with no allow-list, review which roles you map (see security note) before opening self-registration.
