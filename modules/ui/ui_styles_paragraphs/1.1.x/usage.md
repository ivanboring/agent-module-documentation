UI Styles Paragraphs is the bridge module that lets UI Styles' predefined style options be applied to paragraphs, so an editor picks "muted background, wide container" from a list rather than typing CSS classes.

---

UI Styles is the design-system approach to editorial styling: a theme declares the styles it supports — spacing scales, colour variants, container widths — as YAML, and those become selectable options wherever UI Styles is wired in. Blocks and layouts are supported out of the box; paragraphs are not, and this module supplies that connection. It is deliberately tiny: `src/Plugin` and nothing else besides the info, composer and licence files, with no routes, permissions or configuration. Composer requires `paragraphs ^1.0` and `ui_styles ^1.6`, and core is `^9 || ^10 || ^11`. The release is **1.1.0-alpha2**, an alpha. The value of the pattern is that styling options are governed by the theme rather than invented per paragraph: editors get a closed list that the design system guarantees exists, instead of a free-text class field that silently produces nothing when misspelled — the failure mode of the "add a CSS class" modules this replaces.
