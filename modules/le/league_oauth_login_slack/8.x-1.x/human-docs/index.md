# League OAuth Login Slack — manual setup guide

**League OAuth Login Slack** (`league_oauth_login_slack`) adds **Slack** as a
sign‑in source for the
[League OAuth Login](../../league_oauth_login/2.0.x/human-docs/index.md) module,
so users can log in to your Drupal site with their Slack account. It is a provider
*plugin*: on its own it does nothing, but paired with the base module it lights up
"log in with Slack".

The plugin supplies the Slack OAuth2 provider configuration — the endpoints and
identity mapping specific to Slack. Everything else, the entire login flow (the
redirect out to Slack, the callback, the token exchange, and account
provisioning), lives in the **base** `league_oauth_login` module. You enable this
plugin, register a Slack OAuth app, and enter its client ID, client secret, and
redirect URI in the League OAuth Login configuration.

Because the login flow belongs to the base module, so does its security posture.
The base module carries a recorded weakness in its OAuth **state** check — it
**fails open when the user's session has no stored state**, an OAuth login‑CSRF /
session‑swap risk — and Slack logins ride that same flow. That finding applies to
Slack logins too: review the base module's security notes and apply its fix (deny
whenever the `state` does not equal the session state, including when the session
state is empty). Store the Slack **client secret** as a secret and always serve
the site over **HTTPS**. This plugin adds no access‑control logic of its own.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer and enable the
   plugin alongside League OAuth Login.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — register a Slack OAuth app and enter
   its client ID, secret, and redirect URI.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

This submodule adds no page of its own; you configure the Slack provider from the
League OAuth Login configuration, entering the client ID, client secret, and
redirect URI for Slack there.
