Register with OTP bolts a 5-digit email OTP check onto Drupal's core user registration form so that anonymous users must prove control of their email address before an account is created.

---

The module swaps the user `register` form class for `Drupal\register_with_otp\Form\RegisterWithOtp` (via hook_entity_type_alter). For anonymous users it adds a "Verify email" AJAX button and a hidden OTP field. Clicking the button (sendOtp) generates an OTP with `random_int(10000, 90000)`, emails it via hook_mail using the themed `mail--otp-validate` template, and stores the OTP, a timestamp, the email, and an `otp_verified` flag in the PHP session. On submit, validateForm checks that the entered OTP matches the session OTP within a 300-second (5-minute) window; changing the email after verification forces re-verification, and registration is blocked until `otp_verified` is TRUE. Session OTP data is cleared on successful submit. A working mail system (SMTP or equivalent) is required, since the OTP is delivered only by email.

Because the OTP is bound to the email in the session and delivered to that address, a user cannot verify an address they do not control — there is no arbitrary-email bypass. Operationally note two weaknesses to be aware of: there is no flood/rate-limiting on OTP requests or on verification attempts (a 5-digit code with unlimited tries in a 5-minute window is brute-forceable, and the send button can be used to send repeated mail), and the generated OTP is written to the log in `sendOtpMail()`. The comparison uses a loose `!=` rather than `hash_equals`, though impact is limited since each session has its own code.
