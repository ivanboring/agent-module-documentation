# Facebook Like Button — manual setup guide

**Facebook Like Button** (`fblikebutton`) automatically adds a Facebook *Like*
button to the content types you choose, so you do not have to paste Facebook's embed
code into every node by hand. It can add a **dynamic** button that likes the page
the visitor is currently on, a **static** button that likes a fixed URL (such as
your homepage), and an optional **block** with a Facebook Like box you can place
site‑wide.

Almost everything about the button is customisable by administrators: size,
position, weight, verbiage, colour scheme, font, and language. You control which
content type(s) show the button and which user role(s) may see it, and by default
the button appears only on a node's full page view — though you can extend it to
teasers too. Users do not need any extra text‑format permission for the button to be
added to their content.

> **Two practical notes.** First, a Like button targets an existing piece of content
> with a valid, *public* URL, so it may not work on a local or offline environment —
> Facebook has to be able to fetch the URL. Second, the button embeds Facebook's
> third‑party script, which can track visitors (even those who never click) and set
> cookies. Obtain appropriate consent, wire it into your cookie‑consent solution, and
> disclose the third‑party tracking as your jurisdiction requires (for example GDPR).

The module is configured at `fblikebutton.settings` and provides its own
permission; it has no access‑control role of its own.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install the module with Composer and
   enable it.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — the settings form, the optional Like
   box block, and the viewing permission.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

The settings form is at the `fblikebutton.settings` route (under **Configuration**).
The *Access FB Like button* permission (at **People → Permissions**) controls which
roles can see the button. See [Configuration](configuration/index.md).
