# Installation

## Requirements

- **Drupal 10 or 11** (`core_version_requirement: ^10 || ^11`).
- **PHP 8.1 or higher.**
- The **Symfony Mailer** module (`symfony_mailer`) — a hard dependency.
- The **`microsoft/microsoft-graph`** library, pinned at exactly **`2.7.0`**
  (Microsoft's official SDK); Composer pulls it in with the module.
- A **Microsoft Azure** app registration granting **Mail.Send**, from which you
  take a **tenant ID**, **client ID**, and **client secret**.

## Install with Composer

From the project root:

```bash
composer require drupal/symfony_mailer_microsoft_graph -W
```

The Composer package name (`drupal/symfony_mailer_microsoft_graph`) matches the
module's machine name (`symfony_mailer_microsoft_graph`). The `-W`
(`--with-all-dependencies`) flag lets Composer update any shared dependencies as
needed, and pulls in Symfony Mailer and the `microsoft/microsoft-graph 2.7.0`
SDK.

> **Using DDEV?** Prefix Composer and Drush with `ddev` when you run from your
> host machine — `ddev composer require drupal/symfony_mailer_microsoft_graph -W`,
> `ddev drush …`. Inside the container (`ddev ssh`) run them without the prefix.

Note the module's `composer.json` declares `minimum-stability: dev`, which can
matter if your project resolves versions strictly.

## Enable the module

```bash
drush en symfony_mailer_microsoft_graph -y
```

## Prepare your credentials securely

You need an Azure app registration with **Mail.Send**, scoped to the specific
mailbox you will send from (an application access policy) rather than granted
tenant-wide. Its **client secret is a live credential** — store it in an
environment variable and surface it through a Key entity; never put it in
exported configuration. Keep the tenant ID and client ID alongside it.

## Next steps

With the module enabled and your credentials ready, add the Graph transport in
Symfony Mailer — see [Configuration](../configuration/index.md).
