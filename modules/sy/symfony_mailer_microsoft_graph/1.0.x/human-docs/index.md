# Symfony Mailer Microsoft Graph — manual setup guide

**Symfony Mailer Microsoft Graph** (`symfony_mailer_microsoft_graph`) sends
Drupal's mail through **Microsoft Graph** rather than SMTP, as a transport for
the **Symfony Mailer** module. It is aimed at Microsoft 365 tenants where SMTP
authentication has been disabled — the same problem that breaks the conventional
`smtp.office365.com` username-and-password setup — for which Graph's `sendMail`
with OAuth application credentials is the supported replacement.

There are two Graph transports for Symfony Mailer, and it helps to know which is
which: the other one, `symfony_mailer_graphapi`, wraps the community
`vitrus/symfony-office-graph-mailer` library (pre-1.0). **This** module instead
uses **`microsoft/microsoft-graph`, pinned at exactly `2.7.0`** — Microsoft's own
official SDK. For something sitting in the mail path, the official SDK at an
exact pin is the more conservative choice, and the exact pin means an SDK update
cannot change behaviour underneath you; the trade-off is that moving the SDK
version needs a new module release. The module depends on **Symfony Mailer**
(`symfony_mailer`), needs **PHP 8.1 or higher**, and works on Drupal 10 and 11.

The credentials are an **Azure app registration** — tenant ID, client ID, and
client secret. The client secret is a live credential: keep it out of exported
config, store it in an environment variable, and surface it through a Key entity.
And scope the app registration to a **specific mailbox** with an application
access policy rather than granting `Mail.Send` tenant-wide — otherwise a
compromised Drupal site could send as anyone in the organisation. (Note also that
the module's `composer.json` sets `minimum-stability: dev`, which matters if you
resolve versions strictly.)

This guide is written for a **human** setting the module up through the admin
UI. If you want terse, token-cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the
sibling [`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install the module and the official
   Graph SDK, and enable it.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — add the Graph transport in Symfony
   Mailer and enter your Azure credentials.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

This module has no admin page of its own — you configure it through **Symfony
Mailer's transport list**, where you add a Microsoft Graph transport and enter
your Azure app credentials.
