# SynCommerce — manual setup guide

**SynCommerce** (`syncommerce`) provides a custom, JavaScript-driven admin screen
for browsing and editing **Drupal Commerce** products and their variations,
backed by a small set of JSON endpoints. It is meant as a fast, staff-facing tool
for bulk product editing — a single screen where you can filter the catalog and
change product and variation details inline, rather than opening each product's
own edit form.

The screen lives at `/syncommerce/products` and hosts a front-end app that talks
to three POST JSON endpoints: a **product listing** (paged and filterable by
article number, title and catalog term, and returning the catalog terms and
attributes too), an **update-product** endpoint (saves a product's title,
article, catalog term and published status), and an **update-variation** endpoint
(saves a variation's price, old/compare-at price, stock quantity, attribute
references and status). The module bundles its own compiled CSS/JS and Twig
templates for the editing UI. It depends on the Commerce module and supports
Drupal 9, 10 and 11.

**Please read this before deploying it.** As written, all four routes — including
the two that *change* data (`updateProduct` and `updateVariation`) — are gated
only by the `access content` permission, which Drupal grants to the anonymous
role by default. That means an unauthenticated visitor could POST to these
endpoints and alter product titles, catalog assignments and published status, and
change variation prices and stock. The module does define an
`administer syncommerce configuration` permission, but it is **not actually
applied to any route**, and there is no CSRF protection on the mutating
endpoints. This is a serious broken-access-control issue. Before using
SynCommerce on any real site, **restrict these routes to a proper Commerce-admin
permission** (and ideally add CSRF protection), so only trusted editors can reach
them. The module is currently marked *not covered* by Drupal's security advisory
policy.

This guide is written for a **human**. If you want terse, token-cheap references
for an AI coding agent, read the sibling [`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs
instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer and enable the
   module.

## How to use it

Once enabled — and once you have restricted its routes as described above — open
**`/syncommerce/products`**. You get an editing screen where you can filter
products by article number, title or catalog term, page through the list, and
edit product fields (title, article, catalog, published status) and variation
fields (price, old price, stock, attributes, status) inline. Changes are saved
straight back to the underlying Commerce product and variation entities. Treat it
as an editor tool for trusted staff only.
