RSS Embed Field turns a Link field into an embedded feed: editors enter a feed URL and the node displays the latest items from that RSS/Atom source.

---

It adds a field widget and formatter (both id `rss_embed_field`) for `link` fields. On save, the widget validates the entered URL by fetching it server-side through the `rss_embed_field.fetcher` service (a Guzzle client, results cached 24h to a temp file) and parsing it with Laminas Feed Reader; invalid feeds raise a form error. The formatter re-fetches (from cache) and renders up to N items, sanitising each item's title/description with `strip_tags` or `Xss::filter` (configurable 'Remove HTML'). **SSRF note:** because the fetch target is the field value, any user permitted to create/edit content with this field can make the server issue a GET to an arbitrary URL, including internal hosts and cloud metadata endpoints — an authenticated, editor-gated SSRF. There is no scheme/host allow-list beyond the link field's own validation. The impact is bounded (the response is only surfaced if it parses as a feed, and editor access is required), but treat the feed URL as attacker-controllable when the field is editable by lower-trust roles.
