# Security Login Secure — manual setup guide

**Security Login Secure** (`security_login_secure`), by miniOrange, is marketed as an
"enterprise-level" security suite, but its core, genuinely useful feature is
**brute-force protection**: it tracks failed login attempts and blocks the offending
IP address or user account after too many failures. Around that it offers IP blocking
and whitelisting (including country and IP-range blocking), login reporting with CSV
export, a delay-based DoS mitigation, role-login-by-IP restrictions, and risk-based
authentication prompts, plus administrator/user notifications for unusual activity.

The brute-force feature is a legitimate and worthwhile control. As with any IP-ban
mechanism, keep two caveats in mind: on shared IPs (corporate NAT, CGNAT, VPNs) a ban
can catch innocent users, and if your site sits behind a reverse proxy you must make
sure Drupal sees the *real* client IP, or the module will end up blocking the proxy
instead of the attacker.

**Please read this before deploying the module.** An independent review of version
3.0.1 found that the module **disables TLS certificate verification on its calls to the
miniOrange backend** (`xecurify.com`) — in **eight** places, including the customer
registration, the **API-key retrieval** (`/rest/customer/key`), and the authentication
challenge; one call additionally disables hostname verification. Those connections are
encrypted but **not authenticated**, which means a man-in-the-middle during setup can
intercept the API key and account credentials, or feed the module forged responses.
The administrator's email and phone number are also transmitted to miniOrange over
those unverified connections. There is no setting to turn verification back on. In
short: a module sold as security ships a man-in-the-middle exposure on its own
credential exchange. Treat this as a **defect to patch** — remove the
`CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER`/`CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` overrides (cURL verifies by default),
or switch the calls to Drupal's HTTP client — before you trust the module, and be aware
that the setup/registration flow is MITM-exposed as shipped.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you are an AI
coding agent, read the sibling [`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs (and the local
`security.md` notes) instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer and enable the
   module.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — the brute-force, IP-blocking, and related
   settings, plus the miniOrange registration caveat.

## How to use it

After enabling, the module adds a **miniOrange Security / Login Security** admin
section where you configure the failed-login thresholds, IP blocking and whitelisting,
reporting, and the other features. Set your brute-force limits there, then test that a
locked-out account and IP behave as you expect.
