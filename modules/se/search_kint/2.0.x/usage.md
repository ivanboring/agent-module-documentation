Search kint adds a search box to Kint's variable dumps, so finding one key in a Drupal render array stops meaning scrolling through several thousand collapsed nodes.

---

Devel's `kint()` is the standard way to inspect a variable in Drupal, and it works well until the variable is a render array or a loaded node — structures nested dozens of levels deep with hundreds of keys, where the thing you want is somewhere inside and Kint's collapsed tree gives no way to find it but expanding branches one at a time. This module adds the missing search: `search_kint.search.js` filters the dump, `search_kint.trail.js` shows the path to a match — which is the genuinely useful half, since knowing a key exists matters less than knowing how to reach it in code. It depends on `devel ^5.1` and `kint-php/kint ^5.0 | ^6.0` and is otherwise four small files, with no routes, permissions or configuration. The release is 2.0.0-beta2 and the core requirement is `^10 || ^11`. As a Devel companion it is a development-only module: Devel itself should not be enabled in production, and this inherits that entirely.
