# Search kint (search_kint) — agent index

Adds search to **Kint** dumps. Depends on `devel ^5.1` and `kint-php/kint ^5.0 | ^6.0`.
Core requirement `^10 || ^11`. **Release is 2.0.0-beta2 — beta.**
No routes, permissions or configuration.

Key facts:
- Whole module: `search_kint.module`, `search_kint.search.js`, **`search_kint.trail.js`**,
  `search_kint.css`, `search_kint.libraries.yml`.
- `search_kint.trail.js` is the genuinely useful half — it shows the **path to a match**, which is
  what you need to reach the value in code. Finding that a key exists is the easy part.
- **Development only.** It depends on Devel, which should not be enabled in production; this
  inherits that restriction entirely.
- Aimed squarely at render arrays and loaded entities — structures where Kint's collapsed tree is
  correct but unnavigable.
