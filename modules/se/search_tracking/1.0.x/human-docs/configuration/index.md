# Configuration

Search Tracking has to be told how to recognise your search form before it records
anything. The setup is two parts: describe the form on the configuration page, then
build a view to display the collected data.

## 1. Describe your search form

Go to **Configuration → Search and metadata → Search Tracking → Form config**
(`/admin/config/search/search-tracking/form-config`) as an administrator, and
enter the attributes that identify your search form:

- **Form ID or class** — you choose whether to match your search form by its
  **ID** or by its **class**. Enter the corresponding value so the bundled
  JavaScript can find the form on the page.
- **Input name** — the `name` attribute of the search input element (the text
  field visitors type into). This is how the module knows which field holds the
  search term. A URL parameter can serve the same purpose for searches submitted
  through the address bar.

Getting these values right matters: if the form ID/class or the input name is
wrong, nothing is captured, and a mistake in the entered attributes will produce an
error. Check them against your actual search form's markup.

When a visitor searches, the module's JavaScript reads the entered term and stores
the **keyword**, the **client IP address**, and the **timestamp** in the
`search_tracking` database table.

## 2. Build the display view

The collected data is shown through Views:

1. Go to **Structure → Views** (`/admin/structure/views`).
2. Add a view using the bundled **Search Tracking** view as a starting point.
3. Customise it — fields, filters, sorting, and access — exactly as you would any
   other view, to present searched keywords, IP addresses, and timestamps the way
   you want.

## Security reminder

Keep in mind that the endpoint receiving these submissions
(`POST /api/form-data`) is effectively **unauthenticated** — it requires only the
*access content* permission (granted to anonymous users) and has no CSRF check,
validation, or rate limiting. Any client can post arbitrary keywords and flood the
table. Values are capped at 100 characters and the insert is parameterised (no SQL
injection), but before relying on this in production you should add access control
and rate limiting in front of that endpoint, and treat the stored IP addresses as
personal data with the retention and access considerations that implies.
