Organization Field stores information associated with an organization as found in the Research Organization Registry (ROR).

---

It provides a field type (`OrganizationFieldItem`) holding an organization name, one or more URLs and a ROR ID URL, an autocomplete widget (`OrganizationFieldWidget`) and two display formatters (a simple default and a configurable one). As the author types, the widget calls the module's own autocomplete controller (`/autocomplete/organization_field`), which queries the ROR REST API (URL set at `/admin/config/content/organization_field`) and returns matching organization names; when a name is not in ROR the user can enter details manually. An uninstall validator and a dedicated field-deletion form ensure fields are cleaned up before the module is removed.

Security-relevant note for operators: the autocomplete route (`JsonApiController::handleAutocomplete`, `src/Controller/JsonApiController.php`) is declared with `_access: 'TRUE'`, so it is reachable anonymously. It XSS-filters the `q` parameter and issues a server-side GET to the ROR API URL taken from module config (not from the request), so it is not an SSRF vector, but it does let unauthenticated users trigger outbound requests to the configured host. Admin settings and the uninstall form are protected by `administer organization_field configuration` / `administer organization_field` (both `restrict access: true`). Typical setup: add the field to a content type, set the ROR API endpoint and result depth, and choose a formatter.
