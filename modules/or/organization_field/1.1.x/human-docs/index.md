# Organization Field — manual setup guide

**Organization Field** (`organization_field`) gives you a field type for storing
information about a research organization the way it appears in the
[ROR (Research Organization Registry)](https://ror.org). ROR is a community‑led
registry of open identifiers for research institutions worldwide, and this module
lets your content authors attach that data to nodes (or any fieldable entity):
the organization's name, one or more web addresses, and its ROR identifier URL.

The heart of the field is an **autocomplete widget**. As an author types an
organization name, the widget calls the module's own lookup endpoint, which in
turn queries the ROR REST API and offers matching organizations. If a name isn't
in ROR, the author can simply enter the details by hand. On display, you choose
between a simple **default formatter** and a **configurable formatter** that lets
you customize labels and how the links are shown.

Because the field is deeply tied to your content model, the module also ships a
careful uninstall path: a dedicated field‑deletion form removes every
organization field from the site before the module can be uninstalled, so you're
never left with orphaned field data.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer and enable the
   module.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — point the module at the ROR API and
   cap the number of autocomplete results.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

The module's settings form sits at **Configuration → Content authoring →
Organization Field** (`/admin/config/content/organization_field`), reachable by
users with the **Administer organization_field configuration** permission.

## How to use it

1. Add an **Organization** field to a content type (or other entity) under
   **Structure → Content types → *(type)* → Manage fields**, choosing the
   Organization field type.
2. On **Manage form display**, the field uses the autocomplete widget — authors
   type a name and pick a match from ROR, or fill in the details manually.
3. On **Manage display**, pick either the **default** or the **configurable**
   formatter. The configurable formatter lets you customize the name/link/
   identifier labels, how many URLs are shown, and how links open.

A security note worth knowing: the autocomplete lookup endpoint is reachable by
anonymous visitors (it has to be, so the widget works on public registration or
submission forms). It only ever calls the ROR API URL you set in configuration —
it does not follow request‑supplied URLs — but it does mean unauthenticated
visitors can trigger outbound lookups to that configured host.
