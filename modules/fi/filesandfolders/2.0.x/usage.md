Files and Folders provides a hierarchical file/folder management UI built on nodes: `folder` and `file` content types organized by a parent-folder reference, with a folder tree, an AJAX file browser, uploads with automatic thumbnail generation (images, PDFs, Office docs via Imagick/LibreOffice), and role-based folder visibility.

It exposes a `/files-and-folders` interface (and a block), plus many AJAX endpoints for listing, creating, renaming, moving, deleting, downloading, and uploading items.

---

- Requires core node/views/file/image/field/field_ui/user/datetime/options; Drupal 9 or 10.
- Enable with `drush en filesandfolders` (machine name `files_and_folders`).
- Configure at `admin/config/files-and-folders/settings` (permission: "administer site configuration") — storage scheme (public/private), custom directory, layout, icon size.
- Grant the module's permissions (access, create/edit/delete own/any folder & file content, view private/public, manage root folders, options).
- Browse at `/files-and-folders`; place the Files and Folders block where needed.
- Folder access is role-based via each folder's `field_authorized_roles`; thumbnail generation for Office docs shells out to LibreOffice (`soffice`) and Imagick.

SECURITY REVIEW — see `agent/start.md` for the code-verified findings (unrestricted file upload gated only by 'access content'; role-restricted file disclosure via the download endpoint). Treat this module as security-sensitive.
