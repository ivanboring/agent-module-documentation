PhotoPrism Integration is a service-oriented client for the PhotoPrism photo-management platform.

---

The core is a `PhotoPrismClient` service (`src/Service/PhotoPrismClient.php`) wrapping the PhotoPrism REST API — status, config, albums, photos, labels, subjects/people, geo, folders, moments and calendar endpoints, plus thumbnail/preview-token URL helpers. Each call goes through a private `request()` method that prepends the configured server URL, attaches an `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header from config and decodes the JSON response, logging and returning NULL on failure. An admin settings form (`/admin/config/media/photoprism`, `administer site configuration`) stores the server URL and access token, and an albums controller (`/admin/config/media/photoprism/albums` and `.../album/{album_uid}`, same permission) lists albums and their photos in the admin UI.

Security-relevant notes for operators: TLS verification is not disabled — the Guzzle client uses default certificate verification (no `verify => false`). The server URL is admin-configured (not request-controlled), so the client is not an SSRF vector. The access token is stored in plain module configuration (`photoprism_integration.settings`) and echoed back into the settings-form field; consider that config export could carry the token, and prefer restricting who holds `administer site configuration`. All routes are admin-permission-gated. Typical setup: create a PhotoPrism app password/token, enter the server URL and token, then browse albums from the admin pages or call the client service from custom code.
