Static Content Iframe (SCI) lets you upload a zipped static site (HTML/CSS/JS with an `index.html`) and render it inside an iframe within your Drupal pages, useful for embedding self-contained micro-sites, reports or interactive builds.

---

SCI defines a `static_content` content entity with its own permissions (`add`/`edit`/`delete`/`view static content entities`, plus `administer static content entities` marked restrict-access). Entity routes live under `/admin/structure/static_content` and are governed by `StaticContentAccessControlHandler` (view requires `view static content entities`, etc.). On the edit form, a `managed_file` element accepts a `.zip`, which is extracted via a batch into `public://static/<md5-hash>/`; the entity records the base URI and the discovered `index.html`, then displays it in an iframe with configurable width/height/autoheight. **Security consideration:** because the archive is extracted into the public files directory and its `index.html` is served same-origin in an iframe, any role granted 'Create/Edit Static content entities' can upload arbitrary HTML/JavaScript that then executes in the site's origin for anyone with 'view static content entities' — effectively a privileged stored-XSS/script-hosting capability, and zip contents are extracted without an explicit path-traversal guard in view. This is inherent to the module's purpose; grant the create/edit/view permissions only to fully trusted roles and treat them as script-injection-capable.
