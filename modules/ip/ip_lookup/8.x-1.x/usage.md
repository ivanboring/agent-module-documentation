User IP Lookup records each time a user logs in — storing the user ID, username, browser name/version/platform, IP address and the city/region resolved from that IP — and shows the collected data in an admin report.

---

On `hook_user_login()` (and new-user insert), the module derives browser details from the User-Agent and looks up geolocation via the `ip_lookup.iplocation` service. That service first checks the local `ip_lookup` table for the client IP, and otherwise queries `https://api.ipdata.co/{ip}?api-key={key}` over the Drupal HTTP client, storing the result. The IP that is looked up is the current request's own client IP (`Request::getClientIp()`), not a value taken from request parameters. The ipdata API key is set at `/admin/config/people/ip-lookup` (defaulting to the shared `test` key); the report lives at `/admin/people/ip-lookup`.

Security review: this is **not** an SSRF vector — the module only ever looks up the connecting client's own IP appended to the fixed `api.ipdata.co` host, never a request-supplied host/URL. There is no anonymous geolocation endpoint; both the report and the settings form require the `access iplookup table` permission (marked `restrict access: TRUE`). The HTTP client uses default TLS verification (no `verify => false`), and stored values are rendered through an escaped `#theme => table`. No findings; note the shared default `test` API key should be replaced with the site's own key.
