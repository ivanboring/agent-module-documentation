Media OpenGraph provides a media entity type with metadata fetched from a link's OpenGraph tags.

---

Media OpenGraph provides a media type built from a link — fetching the target URL's OpenGraph metadata
(title, description, image) to create a rich media entity representing that link (a link preview/card). It
depends on core Media, in the Media package.

Use it to create link-preview media from OpenGraph tags. The security-relevant point: the module **fetches a
remote URL server-side** to read its OpenGraph metadata — if the URL is editor-supplied, restrict who can
create these media (trusted editors), because server-side fetching of arbitrary URLs is a potential SSRF
vector (a URL pointing at internal services). Prefer validating/limiting the fetch and treating fetched
metadata (title/description) as untrusted (escape on display). It has no access-control role. Configure the
OpenGraph media type.
