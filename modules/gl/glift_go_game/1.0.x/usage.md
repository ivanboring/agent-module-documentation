Glift Go Game is a text-format filter that turns `[glift]...[/glift]` tags into an interactive Go (Weiqi/Baduk) board rendered by the bundled Glift JS library.
---
The filter plugin (`FilterGliftGoGame`, id `filter_glift`, TYPE_TRANSFORM_IRREVERSIBLE) uses a regex to find `[glift]ARGS[/glift]` blocks and replaces each with a `<div>` plus an inline `<script>` that calls `glift.create({...})`. A single argument is treated as raw SGF data or an SGF URL; multiple space-separated `key=value` arguments override defaults (`sgf`, `divId`, `theme`, `disableZoomForMobile`, `drawBoardCoords`). Each board gets a unique div id derived from an md4 hash of the arguments. The Glift library itself is bundled in `js/glift_1_1_2.min.js` and attached via the `glift_go_game/glift` library.

There are no routes, permissions, services, or config forms — you enable the filter on a text format and author `[glift]` tags in content. Security review note: `glift_renderer()` builds the `<div>`, inline `<script>` and a download `<a href>` by string-concatenating the user-supplied arguments **without HTML/JS escaping** (only literal quotes are stripped from key/value tokens). Because this is a text filter, only users permitted to use that text format can insert the tags, but such users can inject arbitrary markup/JS into the page via the sgf/argument values — treat the format as trusted and see the security notes below.
---
- Enable the "Glift Go Game Filter" on a text format.
- Embed an SGF game by URL: `[glift]http://example.com/game.sgf[/glift]`.
- Embed raw SGF data inline within a node body.

- Display multiple Go boards on one page.
- Offer a "Download SGF" link alongside each board.
- Publish game commentaries/tsumego on a Drupal site.
- Keep the Glift viewer self-hosted (bundled JS, no CDN).
- Restrict authoring of boards by controlling text-format permissions.
- Only grant the Glift filter to trusted roles (unescaped output).
