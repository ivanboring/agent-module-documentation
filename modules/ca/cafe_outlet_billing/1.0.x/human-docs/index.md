# Cafe Outlet Billing — manual setup guide

**Cafe Outlet Billing** (`cafe_outlet_billing`) is a lightweight,
point-of-sale-style billing tool for a small cafe or outlet. A cashier opens a
billing form, types in line items — each with a name, quantity, and price — and
the module turns those items into a printable PDF invoice. The invoice is
stamped with your site's name and email in the header and totals the items up,
ready to hand to or download for a walk-in customer.

It is deliberately minimal: there is no inventory, no stored orders, and no
payment processing. Think of it as a quick receipt generator rather than a full
commerce system. The form lets you add and remove item rows as you go and
defaults the cashier ID to the logged-in user, and the PDF is produced on the
server using the TCPDF library.

Please note an important security caveat before using this in the real world:
in this version both the billing form and the PDF-generation route are gated
only by Drupal's "access content" permission, which anonymous visitors have by
default — so bill generation is effectively public, and the invoice content
comes entirely from the request. Because there is no stored order or payment
state behind it, the practical risk is limited, but you should place this
behind proper access control (a real permission) before exposing it on a live
site.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token-cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer (it pulls in
   TCPDF), and enable the module and its dependencies.

## Where it lives

Cafe Outlet Billing does not add an admin settings page. It exposes two
front-end routes once enabled:

- **`/billing-form`** — the cashier's form for entering line items. Add and
  remove rows, enter each item's name, quantity, and price, and the form
  calculates per-line and grand totals.
- **`/generate-bill/...`** — produces the invoice as an `application/pdf`
  response, served inline so it can be printed or downloaded.

## How to use it

Enable the module, open **`/billing-form`**, enter the items for the order,
and generate the bill. The resulting PDF carries the site name and email, the
date, the cashier ID, the line items, and the totals — a printable receipt.
Before using it on a public site, re-gate the two routes to a proper permission
so that only staff can reach them.
