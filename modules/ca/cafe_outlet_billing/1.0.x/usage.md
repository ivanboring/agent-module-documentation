Cafe Outlet Billing is a lightweight point-of-sale style tool: a form where a cashier enters line items (name, quantity, price), and a controller that renders those items into a printable PDF invoice using TCPDF (with the site name and email in the header).

Use it as a minimal in-house billing/receipt generator for a small cafe outlet.
---
Enable with Composer (`composer require drupal/cafe_outlet_billing`, pulls `tecnickcom/tcpdf`) then `drush en cafe_outlet_billing` (depends on core `field` and `views`, PHP >= 8.1). The billing form is at `/billing-form` (route `cafe_outlet_billing.form`); the PDF is produced at `/generate-bill/{items}/{cashier_id}` (route `cafe_outlet_billing.generate_bill`) where `{items}` is a URL-encoded JSON array of line items.

Both routes are gated only by the `access content` permission, which is granted to anonymous users by default — so bill generation is effectively public. The form (`src/Form/BillingForm.php`) lets you add/remove rows and defaults the cashier id to the current user; the controller (`CafeOutletBillingController::generateBill()`) decodes the JSON, sums totals, and streams a `application/pdf` response.
