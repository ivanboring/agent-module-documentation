Matomo Noscript adds the `<noscript>` tracking image to every page, so Matomo counts visits from browsers and clients that do not run JavaScript.

---

Matomo's main tracker is JavaScript, and the standard install also emits a `<noscript>` fallback: a one-pixel image request carrying the same tracking parameters, which works because fetching an image needs no script engine. Who that actually captures is worth being clear about, because it is a smaller and stranger group than "users with JavaScript off" — text-mode browsers, some assistive setups, corporate environments with scripting restricted, privacy tooling that blocks scripts but permits images, and a good deal of automated traffic. The project name is the historical one: **Piwik was renamed Matomo in 2018**, and the module name preserves the old spelling while the description does not, which is a search hazard rather than a functional one. Version **2.0.0**, core requirement **`^11.1 || ^12`** — Drupal 11.1 or later, reaching into a major that does not exist yet. Two things to settle before adding it. **Consent applies to the noscript image exactly as it applies to the script** — it is a tracking request to a third-party endpoint regardless of how it is triggered, and a consent manager that blocks JavaScript trackers will not necessarily block an `<img>` in a `<noscript>` block, so this is a common way for tracking to continue after a visitor has declined. And the data it produces is **not comparable** with the main tracker's: no session stitching, no interaction events, no accurate bounce measurement, so it inflates visit counts with shallow records rather than adding equivalent detail.
