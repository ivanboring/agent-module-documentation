Link Icons is a field formatter for core's Link field that renders a Font Awesome icon for the service a link points to — a Facebook glyph for a facebook.com URL, an envelope for a mailto: link, a phone for tel:, and a generic globe for anything unrecognised — optionally shown with or instead of the link text.

---

Install it with `drupal/fontawesome` (`^2 || ^3`) and core's **Link** field, then make sure Font Awesome's icon library actually loads on your pages (via the Font Awesome module) or the icon markup renders as nothing. On a content type's **Manage display** screen, set a Link field's format to **"Link with service icon"** and use the settings cog to choose the eight display options: what text to show beside the icon (`text`), whether to hide the URL scheme (`hideURLscheme`), icon-vs-text order (`order`), icon `size`, fixed/variable `width`, `coloured` vs uncoloured, the preferred `shaped` variant (square/circle/natural), and an optional stacked `background`. Which domains map to which icon is stored as **`link_icon_service`** config entities, managed at **Configuration » Search and metadata » Link icon services** (`/admin/config/search/link_icon_service`), gated by the `administer link icon services` permission — each service holds one or more trailing hostnames plus a Font Awesome icon id, style, optional square/circle variants, colour and CSS class. The base module ships no services; enable the **`link_icons_brands`** submodule to import ~100 ready-made brands (Facebook, X, LinkedIn, GitHub, Spotify, …). You can also switch on icons for a menu's external links per menu, from the menu edit form.
