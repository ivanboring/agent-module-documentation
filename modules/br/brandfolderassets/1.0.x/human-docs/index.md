# Brandfolder Assets — manual setup guide

**Brandfolder Assets** (`brandfolderassets`) lets editors pick media from the
Brandfolder digital asset management (DAM) service and attach it to content
through a field. It adds a field type, a widget, and a formatter, plus an AJAX
modal that lists Brandfolder assets — images, videos, PDFs — with search and
pagination. When an editor selects an asset, the module downloads it from
Brandfolder's CDN into your site's files directory and stores it as a managed
file.

It builds on the separate **Brandfolder** module (`brandfolder`), and it reuses
that module's API key to talk to Brandfolder — so you configure the connection in
the Brandfolder module first, then use this one to place a picker field on your
content types.

This guide is written for a **human** setting the module up through the admin UI.
If you want a terse, token-cheap reference for an AI coding agent, read the
sibling [`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — requirements (including the Brandfolder
   module), installing with Composer, and enabling the module.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — the settings form, plus adding the
   field to a content type.

## Security note — read before exposing to untrusted editors

Be aware of how this version behaves before you give the widget to editors you do
not fully trust. The module's browse and save routes are gated only by "user is
logged in" — any authenticated user can reach them. Two specific weaknesses exist
in this release:

- **Server-side fetch of a user-supplied URL (SSRF).** When an asset is saved,
  the module hands the request-supplied CDN URL straight to Drupal's file-fetch
  helper (`system_retrieve_file()`). That means any logged-in user can make your
  server fetch an arbitrary URL — including internal addresses behind your
  firewall.
- **Reflected input in the modal.** The picker echoes request parameters
  (`field_name` and its delta) into the modal's HTML without escaping, which is a
  reflected cross-site-scripting surface.

Treat this widget as safe only for trusted, authenticated editors, and consider
network controls (blocking the server's access to internal ranges) until these
are hardened. This is documented honestly here so you can make that call — see
the sibling [`security.md`](../security.md) for the full finding.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

The module's own settings form is at **Configuration → Media → Brandfolder
Assets** (`/admin/config/media/brandfolderassets`). The Brandfolder API key
itself is configured in the **Brandfolder** module, not here. You place the field
on content types through the **Field UI**.

## How to use it

First configure the Brandfolder connection (API key, default brandfolder) in the
Brandfolder module. Then add a **Brandfolder Assets** field to a content type via
the Field UI. When editing content, the field opens a modal that lists your
Brandfolder library; search or page through it, pick an asset, and the module
downloads it into your site's files and stores it as a managed file that your
content references.
