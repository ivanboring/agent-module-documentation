Brightcove Video Connect integrates a Drupal site with the [Brightcove](https://www.brightcove.com/) Video Cloud platform: it authenticates via OAuth client-credentials, mirrors Brightcove videos, playlists, players, custom fields, and text tracks into local Drupal entities, and can push new videos back up via Dynamic Ingest.

---

You register one or more **API Clients** (`brightcove_api_client` config entities) at
`/admin/config/media/brightcove_api_client`, each holding a Brightcove Account ID, Client ID, and
secret. `BrightcoveAPIClient::authorizeClient()` exchanges those for an OAuth access token
(`Client::authorize()`, from the `brightcove/api` PHP SDK) cached in an expirable key-value store,
and `BrightcoveUtil` exposes the resulting CMS / Dynamic Ingest / Player Management API wrappers.
Content is synced Brightcove→Drupal through queues (via cron, the `brightcove:sync-all` Drush
command, or the Status Overview page) that populate content entities `brightcove_video`,
`brightcove_playlist`, `brightcove_text_track`, and config-ish entities `brightcove_player` /
`brightcove_custom_field`. Editors create/edit videos locally and the module uploads them to
Brightcove. Two inbound callback routes support push updates: `brightcove/ingestion-callback/{token}`
(protected by a per-video expirable token via a custom `_brightcove_csrf_callback_access_check`) and
`brightcove/notification-callback` (subscription notifications). Subscriptions
(`brightcove_subscription`) register a Brightcove notification endpoint so remote changes flow back.
The module ships a video tags vocabulary, image style, and two Views, integrates Token, and supports
proxied API calls, a Media source, and In-Page Experience galleries through its three submodules
(`brightcove_proxy`, `media_brightcove`, `brightcove_gallery`). A cron settings form and a
per-client "max custom fields" limit round out configuration.

NOTE (see `security.md`): the `brightcove/notification-callback` route is unauthenticated
(`_access: 'TRUE'`) and triggers entity create/update/delete plus outbound Brightcove API calls.
