# Installation

> **Read the security warning first.** The 3.0.1 release has two confirmed
> access-control failures that let anonymous callers read protected content and
> bypass block visibility. See the [security warning](../index.md#security-warning--do-not-expose-the-301-release-as-is)
> before enabling this on any public or multi-user site.

## Requirements

- **Drupal 10 or 11** (`core_version_requirement: ^10 || ^11`).

There are no additional Composer or PHP library requirements.

## Install with Composer

From the project root:

```bash
composer require drupal/block_ajax -W
```

The `-W` (`--with-all-dependencies`) flag lets Composer update any shared
dependencies as needed.

> **Using DDEV?** Prefix Composer and Drush with `ddev` when you run from your host
> machine — `ddev composer require drupal/block_ajax -W`, `ddev drush …`. Inside
> the container (`ddev ssh`) run them without the prefix.

## Enable the module

```bash
drush en block_ajax -y
```

There is no configuration form to complete — the module exposes its AJAX routes as
soon as it is enabled. Before relying on it, consider whether core's **BigPipe** or
a **`#lazy_builder`** meets your need without a public rendering endpoint, and heed
the security warning above.
