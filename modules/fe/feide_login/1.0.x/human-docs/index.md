# Feide Login — manual setup guide

**Feide Login** (`feide_login`) lets people sign in to your Drupal site with
**Feide** — the Norwegian national identity provider used across education and
research. Instead of maintaining a separate Drupal username and password, a user
clicks "Log in with Feide", authenticates on Feide's own login screen, and is
returned to your site already logged in.

Under the hood the module runs a standard **OAuth 2.0 authorization‑code flow**.
When the user returns from Feide, the module reads their Feide profile and maps
them to a Drupal account **by email address** using the
[External Authentication](https://www.drupal.org/project/externalauth)
(`externalauth`) module. If no matching account exists yet, it can optionally
**auto‑register** one. Your Feide application's client credentials are held with
the [Key](https://www.drupal.org/project/key) module, so the client secret lives
in an environment variable rather than in configuration or code.

The trust model is the usual one for federated single sign‑on: you register an
application with Feide, Feide gives you a client ID and client secret, and your
site trusts the identity Feide asserts on the callback. That makes the callback
the sensitive part of the flow.

> **Security note — read before going live.** In this release the authorization
> request does **not** send an OAuth `state` parameter, and the
> `/feide_redirect` callback performs **no `state`/CSRF check** before logging the
> browser in. That is a login‑CSRF weakness: an attacker could force a victim's
> browser into the *attacker's* account. This is documented in the module's own
> agent notes. Treat the module as not production‑ready until `state` generation
> and verification are added, and review the project's issue queue for a fix.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer and enable the
   module together with its ExternalAuth and Key dependencies.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — register your Feide application,
   store the client secret safely with Key, and wire up user mapping.

## How to use it

Once installed and configured, Feide Login adds a "Log in with Feide" entry point
to your site. A visitor who chooses it is redirected to Feide, authenticates
there, and is sent back to the module's `/feide_redirect` callback, which finalises
the Drupal login through ExternalAuth (creating the account first if
auto‑registration is enabled). Day‑to‑day there is nothing more for an editor to
do — the work is all in the one‑time setup covered in
[Configuration](configuration/index.md).
