# AI Log Analysis — manual setup guide

**AI Log Analysis** (`ai_log_analysis`) records your site's log messages into its
own table and lets an administrator ask an AI provider to explain a given entry
and suggest a fix. When a cryptic error shows up in the logs, instead of pasting
it into a search engine you click **Analyze** next to it, and the module sends
that entry to your configured AI model and shows back an interpretation and
recommended next steps.

It builds on Drupal's **AI** module for model access — you configure the provider
and its API key once there — and captures log messages through its own logger
service, storing them separately from core's standard log (dblog). From the admin
list you can page through captured messages, analyze any one of them, and clear
the whole table when you want a clean slate. There is also a Drush command for
analyzing error logs from the command line.

One security point to weigh carefully. The **log list page is served without an
access check** (`_access: TRUE`), which means anonymous visitors can view the
captured log messages if they reach that URL. Logs routinely contain sensitive
details — file paths, stack traces, error internals — so on any production or
public site you should restrict that page at the web-server or reverse-proxy level
(or keep the module to trusted, non-public environments) until this is locked
down. The analyze, clear and settings actions themselves are properly gated behind
the site-configuration permission. Note too that analyzing an entry sends its
contents to the external AI provider, so treat log data as potentially sensitive
before sending it out.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer and enable the
   module.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — the settings form and how to analyze
   entries, plus the security caveat.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

- **Settings:** `/admin/config/system/ai-log-analysis`
  (**Administer site configuration**).
- **Log list:** `/admin/ai-log-analysis/logs` — **note:** this route currently has
  no access check (see the caution above).
- **Analyze an entry:** `/admin/ai-log-analysis/logs/{key}`.

## How to use it

1. Enable the module (it needs the AI module with a working provider) and open the
   settings form.
2. Let the logger capture messages, then open the log list and click **Analyze**
   on any entry to get an AI interpretation and suggested fix.
3. Clear the captured logs when you want to reset. See
   [Configuration](configuration/index.md) for details — and read the security
   note before exposing this on a public site.
