AI Log Analysis records log messages into its own table and lets admins analyze individual entries with an AI provider to get insights and suggested fixes.

---

Install the module (requires the AI module) and configure it at /admin/config/system/ai-log-analysis (permission: administer site configuration). A logger service captures messages; the log list is at /admin/ai-log-analysis/logs and per-entry analysis at /admin/ai-log-analysis/logs/{key}. SECURITY: the logs list route uses _access: 'TRUE' (anonymous can view captured log messages).
