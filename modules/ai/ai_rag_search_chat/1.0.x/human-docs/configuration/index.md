# Configuration

All settings live on one form.

## Open the settings form

1. Log in as a user with the **Administer AI RAG search chat** permission.
2. Go to **Configuration → AI → AI RAG Search Chat**, or navigate directly to
   `/admin/config/ai/ai-rag-search-chat`.

The form is grouped into sections. The most important ones are below.

## Which content to search (RAG)

- **Search indices** — the Search API index IDs the chat retrieves from. This is
  the single most important setting: list the index(es) built over the content
  you want the chat to answer from.
- **Retrieval tuning** — how many chunks to pull (`top_k`, default 5), how many
  sources to aim for, the minimum relevance score to accept (`min_score`,
  default 0.3), and the **context token budget** (default 4000) that caps how
  much retrieved text is fed to the model.
- **Filter by language** (on by default) and an optional **supplementary keyword
  search** alongside the semantic retrieval, with its own stop‑word list.

## The AI model (LLM)

- **Provider and model** — choose which AI provider and model answers questions.
  You can set a separate **fast model** for lighter work and a **title model**
  used to name conversations.
- **No API keys are entered here.** Provider credentials come from the AI module
  and the Key module — this form only selects which configured provider/model to
  use.

## Prompt and wording

- **System instructions** — the system prompt that frames how the assistant
  answers.
- **Term map** — a mapping you can use to steer terminology.
- **Empty‑response message** — what visitors see when nothing relevant is found.

## History retention

- **Max messages** kept per conversation (default 10), and how long sessions are
  retained: **30 days** for authenticated users and **2 days** for anonymous
  visitors by default. Cron prunes older sessions automatically.

## Rate limits

Rate limiting is **on by default** and protects the LLM‑calling endpoints from
abuse. You can tune:

- **Message limits** — 30/hour for authenticated users, 10/hour for anonymous,
  over a configurable window (default one hour).
- **Session‑creation limits** — the same 30/10 split over its own window.

> Leave **rate limiting enabled**. Turning it off removes throttling from the
> endpoints that call (and are billed by) your AI provider — a cost‑abuse risk,
> especially if you have granted *Access AI RAG search chat* to anonymous users.

## Search / chat / UI

Page titles, how sources are displayed (`source_display_mode`, default teaser),
how many sources per page, an optional typewriter effect, and a toggle for
loading a Tailwind stylesheet.

## Save

Click **Save configuration**. Then test `/ai-search` and `/ai-search/chat` with a
question whose answer is in your indexed content.

## Security reminder

Grant **Access AI RAG search chat** only to trusted roles. In this release the
`/api/search/sources/render` endpoint renders client‑supplied entity references
without a `view` access check, so a permission holder could render entities not
returned by RAG (including unpublished nodes). Restricting the permission is the
practical mitigation until a `view` access gate is added.
