AI Content Summarizer produces AI summaries and SEO title suggestions for nodes, using its own pluggable LLM provider layer (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama).
---
The module ships a small provider abstraction (`LlmProviderManager` + `LlmProviderInterface`) with implementations for OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google Gemini and local Ollama. `ContentSummarizer::summarizeNode()` extracts text from configured source fields, builds a prompt from a configurable template, calls the active provider over Guzzle, truncates to a max length, and stores the result in the `ai_content_summary` table. Optional title suggestions are parsed from a second prompt. Summaries can be generated manually or auto-generated on node save (`hook_node_presave`), and rendered on node view.

Operate it from `/admin/config/content/ai-summarizer` (`administer ai content summarizer`): choose the provider, enter its API key, select enabled content types, source fields, prompts and behaviour. Manual runs use `/admin/content/ai-summarize` (bulk list) and the per-node summarize route (`use ai content summarizer`, CSRF-protected). NOTE: provider API keys are stored in plaintext module config via plain textfields (not the Key module); the Gemini provider additionally passes the key in the request URL query string. These are cost-bearing external calls, but every trigger route is behind the `use ai content summarizer` permission.
