Exif reads EXIF, IPTC and XMP metadata out of uploaded JPEG images and copies it into Drupal fields on nodes, media entities, and files, so camera/photo metadata can be displayed, filtered, or turned into taxonomy terms.

---

Exif extracts image metadata via one of two backends — the PHP `exif`/`iptcparse` extensions (default) or an external `exiftool` binary — selected on the settings page (`admin/config/media/exif`, route `exif.config`). You enable it per bundle by ticking the node/media/file types to scan, then adding fields to that bundle and assigning one of the module's form widgets: `exif_readonly` (viewable read-only value), `exif_hidden` (populated but not shown on the form), or `exif_html` (a full HTML table of every tag). Each widget instance is bound to an image field and to a metadata tag, chosen either explicitly or by the `field_<section>_<tag>` naming convention (e.g. `field_exif_model`, `field_ifd0_datetime`). On `hook_entity_presave`/`hook_entity_create` the module reads the linked image, resolves the requested tag(s), and writes the value into the field, with special handling for text, date/datetime, and taxonomy-term reference fields (auto-creating a `section > tag > value` term hierarchy). A quick-start helper (`admin/config/media/exif/helper`) can scaffold a "photography" vocabulary, node type, or media type, and a sample page renders all tags found in the bundled `sample.jpg`. Legacy Drush 8-style commands (`exif-list`, `exif-update`, `exif-import`) are declared in `exif.drush.inc`. Note that extracted metadata is attacker-controlled file content: the `exif_html` widget stores it as `full_html`, so review the security note before exposing it to untrusted uploaders.

- Show the camera make and model on photo nodes by adding `field_exif_make` / `field_exif_model` fields.
- Record the shot date from `DateTimeOriginal` into a datetime field (`field_exif_datetimeoriginal`).
- Display exposure settings (ExposureTime, FNumber, ISO, FocalLength) on a photography content type.
- Render a complete metadata table for an image using the `exif_html` widget on a `text_long` field.
- Populate a field silently with the `exif_hidden` widget for use in Views filters without showing it on the edit form.
- Extract GPS latitude/longitude tags (use ImageMagick, not GD, to avoid GPS stripping).
- Turn IPTC keywords into taxonomy terms in a dedicated vocabulary.
- Auto-build a `section > tag > value` taxonomy hierarchy from image metadata.
- Fill an empty node title from metadata on creation (the module inserts an `EXIF_FILLED` placeholder title).
- Read XMP fields such as Artist, Title, Keywords, Orientation.
- Scan media entities as well as classic nodes by enabling the relevant media types.
- Scan bare file entities (bundle `file`) for metadata.
- Split a multi-value metadata string into multiple field values with a one-character separator.
- Switch the extraction backend from the PHP extension to `exiftool` for richer tag coverage.
- Configure the date parse format used to interpret EXIF date strings.
- Bulk re-read metadata for all entities of a type after a config change via `drush exif-update`.
- Import a directory tree of JPEGs as nodes/media with metadata via `drush exif-import`.
- List which bundles currently have EXIF extraction enabled via `drush exif-list`.
- Scaffold a ready-made "photography" vocabulary, node type, or media type from the helper page.
- Preview every tag available on a reference image via the sample page.
- Use the `exif_readonly` widget so editors can see (but not edit) the extracted value inline.
- Choose which image field on a multi-image bundle supplies the metadata.
- Keep existing values on update by leaving `update_metadata` off (only fill on insert).
- Optionally overwrite metadata fields on every save by enabling `update_metadata`.
- Provide a D7-to-D8+ migration field plugin (`ExifReadOnly`) when upgrading legacy Exif fields.
