Embed Block lets editors drop a block into body text with a `{block:plugin_id}` placeholder, which a text filter replaces with the rendered block — access-checked against the current user.

---

The whole module is one filter plugin. `EmbedBlockFilter::process()` scans the text for `{block:...}` with the regex `/{block:(?<plugin_id>[^}].*)}/`, and for each distinct match instantiates that block plugin through `plugin.manager.block`, checks `$block_plugin->access($this->currentUser)`, renders it and substitutes the markup for the placeholder. Three behaviours are deliberate: a block the user cannot access is replaced with an **empty string** rather than left as a visible placeholder; an unknown plugin id throws `PluginException`, which is caught and the placeholder is left untouched; and repeated placeholders for the same plugin are processed once and replaced everywhere. The plugin is added as a cacheable dependency of the filter result. Because it is an ordinary text filter, it is enabled per text format at `/admin/config/content/formats`, which is also the control over who can use it — anyone who can write in a format with the filter enabled can embed any block plugin the *viewer* is allowed to see. The installed release is `8.x-1.0-alpha4`; treat it accordingly, and see `security.md` at this module's root for the caching caveat.
