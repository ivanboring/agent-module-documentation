# Role request — manual setup guide

**Role request** (`role_request`) adds a self-service **request → approve** workflow
for roles. Instead of an administrator granting every role by hand, a user can
request one or more roles from their profile page, and a designated role manager
reviews the request and approves or denies it. On approval, the requested roles are
granted to the user. The classic use case is a community site where members apply
for elevated status.

The workflow is: a user (with the *Request role* permission) submits a request,
optionally with a message explaining why; the request is created as "pending
review"; an administrator with the *Administer role requests* permission reviews it
and approves or denies it, optionally attaching a note; and on approval the roles
are actually granted. Approval and denial emails can be configured with tokens to
personalize the message.

The module requires Drupal 11 and depends on core's User module.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer and enable the
   module.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — choose which roles can be requested,
   set permissions, and configure the emails.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

Once enabled, configure the module at **Configuration → People → Role request**
(`/admin/config/people/role-request`). Users make requests from their own profile
page, and role managers review them.

## Important: this permission is powerful

Read this before you assign the *Administer role requests* permission. On this
release, the request form offers **all** roles (only the built-in anonymous and
authenticated roles are excluded), and approval — gated **only** by *Administer role
requests* — grants whatever role was requested, **including the `administrator`
role**, without the additional check core normally applies for granting privileged
roles. In practice that means **anyone with *Administer role requests* can escalate
a user (or themselves) to full administrator.**

So treat *Administer role requests* as equivalent to full site administration, give
it only to people you would trust with the superuser account, and — as covered in
[Configuration](configuration/index.md) — do **not** offer privileged roles in the
list of requestable roles.
