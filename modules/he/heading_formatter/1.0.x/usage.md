Heading formatter is a field formatter that outputs a plain-text (string/textfield) field as an HTML heading with an optional CSS class.

The `heading` formatter plugin applies to `string` and `textfield` field types. On Manage Display an editor picks the tag (h1, h2 or h3) and enters a class string; at render time each field value is emitted through a core `html_tag` render element using the chosen tag and class. It is a tiny display-only helper with no configuration outside the formatter settings, no routes, services or permissions.

One implementation note worth flagging: the formatter renders the field value via `#type => html_tag` with the raw value assigned to `#value`, and the class string is placed directly into the tag attributes. Because `html_tag`'s `#value` is not run through output escaping, any HTML present in the underlying string field would be emitted unescaped — a low-severity stored-XSS consideration that only matters if untrusted users can edit the field's contents (or the class setting). Typical setup: on a content type's Manage Display, set the target string field's formatter to "Heading", choose the level and class, and save.
