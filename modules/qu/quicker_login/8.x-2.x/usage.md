A developer convenience module that logs you in as any user, or lets you view any page as any user, without a password.

---

Visiting `/user/ql/{user_name}` runs `QuickerLoginController::login()` → `QuickerLoginService::loginUserName()`, which loads the named user and calls `user_login_finalize()` to establish a full session as that account. A request subscriber (`QuickerLoginSubscriber`) additionally watches every request for a `ql=` (or `returnto` with `ql=`) query parameter and performs the same login before redirecting back, so appending `?ql={user_name}` to any URL loads that page as the chosen user. While enabled, `hook_preprocess_page` prints a persistent warning that Quick Login is on and must not be used in production.

This is intentionally a password-less impersonation tool with the login route declared `_access: 'TRUE'`, so it must never be enabled on a public or production site — anyone who can reach the path can become any user, including administrators. It is meant for local development and automated testing where quickly switching identities is useful. (A security finding for this behaviour is already recorded for this version.)

---
- Log in as any user for local development
- Visit `/user/ql/{user_name}` to become that user
- View any page as a specific user via `?ql={user_name}`
- Return to the original URL after impersonating (returnto handling)
- Speed up manual testing of role-specific behaviour
- Reproduce a user-specific bug quickly
- Drive automated/browser tests that need identity switching
- See the always-on warning that the module is enabled
- Switch identity without knowing passwords in a dev environment
- Remove before deploying to any shared/production environment
- Log in as an editor to verify content workflows
- Log in as an anonymous-equivalent low-privilege account
- Jump straight to a user-specific dashboard while testing
- Chain a login with a returnto URL for deep-link testing
- Confirm role/permission changes by impersonating quickly
- Use in CI to seed an authenticated browser session
