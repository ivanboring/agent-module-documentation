Quote adds "quote" links below nodes and comments; clicking one inserts the source text into a new comment (or reply) form so users can respond to specific content.

---

The module is driven by hook implementations in `QuoteHooks` (autowired service). `hook_node_links_alter` and `hook_comment_links_alter` add up to four link variants — *quote selected*, *quote all*, *reply and quote all*, *reply and quote selected* — but only when the entity/comment's bundle is enabled in config, comments are open, and the current user has both `post comments` and the `use quote` permission. The links attach `js/quote.js` plus `drupalSettings` that tell the JavaScript which CSS selectors identify the comment textarea, the node/comment body, and the author name, whether CKEditor 5 support is enabled, a character `quote_limit`, and whether raw HTML tags are allowed; the JS copies the selected or full body (optionally the author) into the comment field. The "reply and quote all" variant links to the core comment reply route with a `comment-quote-all-reply` query parameter; `hook_form_alter` then pre-fills the reply form's body with a `<blockquote>` of that comment (truncated to `quote_limit`). A settings form at `/admin/config/content/quote` (permission `administer quote`) controls the enabled modes, allowed content types, comment quoting, CKEditor support, selectors, limit, and HTML-tag support, and flushes caches on save.

Typical setup is to enable the module, grant `use quote` to commenting roles, and on the settings form choose which content types allow quoting and which quote modes to expose. Security observation: `hook_form_alter` loads the comment named by the `comment-quote-all-reply` query parameter and pre-fills the reply body from it **without an access check** on that comment (`QuoteHooks.php:209`, body read at `:214`), so a crafted `?comment-quote-all-reply=<cid>` can surface another comment's body text to a user who can post comments regardless of whether they may view that comment — a low-severity information disclosure. The injected text is placed as a text-format widget default value (filtered on submit) and the author name is escaped via `t()`.
