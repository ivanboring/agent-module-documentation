**Social Auth Strava** adds a *Log in with Strava* button to Drupal, built on the [Social API](https://www.drupal.org/project/social_api) / [Social Auth](https://www.drupal.org/project/social_auth) framework and the `league/oauth2-client`-style Strava SDK. Anonymous users authorize at Strava, are redirected back, and Social Auth matches or creates a Drupal account keyed to their Strava athlete id.

---

A Network plugin `StravaAuth` (`initSdk()`) constructs a `Strava\API\OAuth` client from the configured `client_id` / `client_secret` and the module's callback redirect URI. The controller `StravaAuthController` exposes two anonymous routes (both `no_cache: TRUE`): `/user/login/strava` (`redirectToStrava`) builds the authorization URL (scopes default `read_all`) and issues a `TrustedRedirectResponse` to Strava; `/user/login/strava/callback` (`callback`) exchanges the returned `code` for an access token via `StravaAuthManager::authenticate()`, fetches athlete info with `getUserInfo()`, and hands name / email / athlete-id / token / picture to `social_auth`'s `UserAuthenticator::authenticateUser()`. Because Strava no longer returns an email, `getUserInfo()` sets email to `NULL`, so Social Auth matches purely on the Strava athlete id via its provider-mapping table rather than by email. Settings form `social_auth_strava.settings_form` (`/admin/config/social-api/social-auth/strava`, permission *administer social api authentication*) stores client id/secret and comma-separated scopes. **Security note (reported separately):** the `callback` does **not** verify an OAuth `state` parameter — `redirectToStrava` never persists `getState()` to the session and `callback` never compares it — leaving the login flow open to login-CSRF (see security review). Token exchange itself runs server-to-server over the SDK's HTTPS client (TLS verification not disabled).
