Views Advanced Cache adds a Views cache plugin exposing cache tags, cache contexts and output/results caching as configuration.

---

Views' built-in caching options are time-based — cache the query for an hour, cache the output for a day — which is the crudest possible answer and the one that produces both of the failures people complain about. Too short and the cache does nothing; too long and the listing shows deleted content. Drupal's own model is better and Views does not expose it: **cache tags** invalidate precisely when the thing they name changes, so a view of articles tagged `node_list` is correct the instant an article is saved and cached indefinitely otherwise; **cache contexts** declare what the result varies by, so a view that differs per user says so instead of being cached wrongly or not at all. Putting both in the Views UI is the difference between a listing that is fast and correct and one that is one or the other. Version **2.0.2** on core `^10.3 || ^11`. **The risk is entirely on the contexts side and it is severe, because getting it wrong is not a performance bug.** A view whose results depend on the current user — anything filtered by ownership, by group membership, by role, or simply subject to node access — must declare the contexts that capture that. Omit them and the first visitor's results are stored and served to everyone, which is a disclosure rather than a stale page. Tags are the forgiving half: a missing tag means stale content, which is visible and embarrassing. A missing context means one user seeing another's, which is neither. So the working rule when configuring this is: **be generous with tags, and be exact about contexts** — and test with two accounts that should see different results, in both orders.
