Views Share lets you embed and share a Views display externally: it adds a "share" Views area handler and a set of routes that render a display as a standalone embeddable page, an oEmbed document, an iframe snippet, and a share modal.

---

The routes hang off `/view/{view_id}/{display_id}/{share|embed|oembed|preview}` and are all gated by `access content`. `ViewsShareController` builds a bare HTML page for embedding (`buildViewResponse`), returns oEmbed JSON/XML, and opens a modal share form; a `ViewsShareHelper` produces the embed URL/HTML/iframe code. Optional per-view share options (from the area handler) control iframe size, link rewriting, and hiding of header/footer/attachment handlers. Contextual view arguments can be passed via a `views_share_args` query parameter.

Security review: the `embed` and `oembed` handlers correctly call `$view->access($display_id)` before executing, so a display's own access plugin is respected. However `preview()` (`src/Controller/ViewsShareController.php:174-198`) executes and renders the view **without** calling `$view->access()`, so any user with `access content` can reach `/view/{view_id}/{display_id}/preview` for a display whose Views access is restricted (role/permission) and see its results — a view-access bypass on the preview route (the `modal()` route only renders the share form, not view results). Operators embedding restricted views should be aware of this; the safe surface is `embed`/`oembed`. Setup: add the "Share" area handler to a view display's header/footer, configure embed options, then use the generated embed/oEmbed URLs.
