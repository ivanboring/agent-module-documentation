Views Table Client-Side Download (CSV) provides a Views area handler that drops a "Download CSV" button into a table-style view; clicking it builds a CSV from the already-rendered table and downloads it in the browser.

---

The area plugin (`Button`, `@ViewsArea("views_table_cs_download_csv_button")`) can only be added to displays whose style plugin is the core *Table* (its `validateOptionsForm` rejects unsupported styles, and it also supports the contrib *Views flipped table*). When rendered, it emits a `<button>` carrying a JSON data attribute (view id, display id, filename, target-table identifier) and attaches the `initiator` JS library. A preprocess hook tags the matching table with a `data-...-target-table` attribute so the script can find it. On click, `js/initiator.js` walks the table's `tr`/`td`/`th` cells, wraps each cell's `innerText` in double quotes, joins rows, and triggers a Blob download. Because the export reads the rendered DOM, only the rows currently visible are exported — paged results export a single page (the README points to views_data_export for full-dataset server-side export).

There is no server route, controller, or permission of its own: access is entirely governed by the host view's access settings, since the data is already on the page the user is viewing. Two things worth noting about the CSV output: the JS does not escape embedded double quotes and does not neutralize spreadsheet formula-trigger characters (a cell whose text begins with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` is exported verbatim), so exported content can carry CSV/formula-injection payloads that execute when the file is opened in a spreadsheet — an issue proportional to whether the view can display attacker-influenced field values.

- Add a client-side "Download CSV" button to a Table-style view.
- Let users export the current page of a Views table without a server round-trip.
- Export a filtered/sorted table exactly as displayed.
- Provide CSV download on a public report view gated only by the view's own access.
- Add the button to a Views flipped table display.
- Set a custom download filename (derived from the view title).
- Place the button in a view header or footer area.
- Offer a lightweight export where full-dataset server export is unnecessary.
- Give editors a quick CSV of an admin listing they are already viewing.
- Combine with exposed filters so users export their filtered result set.
- Avoid extra module dependencies beyond core Views.
- Export tabular data for spreadsheets from a dashboard view.
- Restrict export visibility by restricting the host view's access.
- Prevent adding the button to unsupported (non-table) style plugins.
- Support multi-column tables including header cells in the output.
- Download the table as a `.csv` Blob generated in the browser.
- Add a self-serve data grab to a members-only view.
- Use on a paged view knowing only the visible page is exported.
- Skip server load for small tables that fit on one page.
- Pair with views_data_export when the full dataset must be exported instead.
