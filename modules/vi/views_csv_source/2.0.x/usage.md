Views CSV Source adds a Views query backend that reads rows from a CSV file instead of the database, so a spreadsheet — a managed file, a local path, or one fetched over HTTP — can be listed, sorted, filtered, related and aggregated with the whole Views toolkit.

---

Views is Drupal's listing engine and it normally queries SQL. This module supplies an alternative query plugin (`src/Plugin/views/query/ViewsCsvQuery.php`, backed by `src/Query/Connection.php` and `src/Query/Select.php`) that parses CSV via `league/csv ^9.27` and exposes the columns as Views fields. When you build a view you pick "CSV" in the "Show" field, then open the Query "Settings" and enter the source as one of three URI forms: an `entity:file/{fid}` reference to an uploaded managed file (an autocomplete restricted to `text/csv` files by the module's own selection handler), an `internal:/path` path relative to the docroot, or an `http(s)` URL fetched with Guzzle. The HTTP branch supports GET or POST with configurable headers and a multipart request body, so it can also consume a CSV-returning REST endpoint, and remote responses are cached for a configurable TTL. Version 2.0 adds a rich handler set: a plain text filter plus options/select, numeric, date and combine filters, string and date sorts, a contextual-filter argument, a "Constant Value" field, aggregation (count/sum/avg/min/max with group-by), and CSV-to-CSV relationships (joins). The URI accepts Drupal and Views tokens (including view arguments), so contextual filters can point the view at a different file per request. A settings form at `/admin/config/user-interface/views-csv-source-settings` (gated by `administer site configuration`) sets the remote cache duration, and a `PreCacheEvent` lets other code rewrite CSV content before it is cached. Because the source URI is a *view* setting configured with `administer views`, and the `internal:` branch is not confined to the docroot, understand this module's local security notes before enabling it.
