# Fast2sms — manual setup guide

**Fast2sms** (`sms_fast2sms`) is a gateway plugin that lets Drupal's **SMS
Framework** deliver outbound text messages through the **Fast2SMS** bulk SMS API,
a popular service for sending SMS to Indian mobile numbers. The module doesn't
send SMS on its own; it registers Fast2sms as a gateway that the framework can
route messages through. Once you've created the gateway and set it as the site
default, any SMS the framework dispatches — OTPs, notifications, bulk sends — goes
out through Fast2SMS.

The module depends on the **SMS Framework** module (`smsframework`, machine name
`sms`) and has no other external dependencies; setup is simply a matter of adding
your Fast2SMS API key. It is minimally maintained (maintenance fixes only), and
its maintainers are not affiliated with the Fast2SMS group.

On the security side there's nothing alarming: messages are sent over **HTTPS** to
the fixed endpoint `https://www.fast2sms.com/dev/bulkV2` with Guzzle's default TLS
verification left on, and because the endpoint is fixed there's no request‑forgery
surface. The one thing to be aware of is that your **API key is stored in the
gateway configuration in plain text** — this is the standard SMS Framework pattern
(it does not use a Key entity), so protect your exported configuration
accordingly.

This guide is written for a **human** setting the gateway up through the admin UI.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer and enable the
   module (plus its SMS Framework dependency).
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — create the Fast2sms gateway and
   enter your API key, route, and sender id.

## How to use it

After you install the module and configure a Fast2sms gateway (see
[Configuration](configuration/index.md)), set it as SMS Framework's default
gateway. From then on any feature that sends SMS through the framework will
deliver via Fast2SMS. You can send a test message to a single recipient to
confirm connectivity, and successful sends return message ids that the framework
records as delivery reports.
