Smashing Invoice is an admin tool for generating hour- or month-based tax invoices: it manages employees, clients, client/employee allocations and organization details in custom database tables and renders a downloadable PDF invoice via the TCPDF library.
---
An index page (`invoice/links`) links all the operations. Forms add/edit employees, clients, allocations, organization info, and generate invoices (hour-based or month-based). Controllers list employees, clients, allocations and invoices, delete records, and build the invoice PDF. Data lives in five custom tables (`invoice_table`, `employee_table`, `client_table`, `allocation_table`, `organization_info_table`) — the organization table holds bank account number, IFSC, PAN and GSTIN. The invoice PDF (`company_invoice_controller`, route `company_invoice.pdf`) reads an `invoice_number` from the request, joins the invoice and client tables, and outputs an inline `Invoice.pdf` through TCPDF. Requires the `tecnickcom/tcpdf` Composer library.

Every route requires the single `administer smashing_invoice` permission, so there are no anonymous endpoints and the invoice PDFs and financial/PII data are not exposed to the public; there is no per-record ownership model (it is one admin realm). Two review cautions for agents: the three delete controllers (`delete/employee`, `delete/client`, `delete/allocation`) and several list/PDF handlers read identifiers directly from `$_GET`/`$_REQUEST` and perform the delete on a plain GET request with **no CSRF token**, so a delete link can be triggered cross-site against a logged-in administrator. All database access uses the query builder with parameterised conditions (no SQL injection), and invoice HTML is emitted only into the TCPDF document. Setup: install TCPDF, enable the module, add your organization info, then add clients/employees, allocate them, and generate invoices.
