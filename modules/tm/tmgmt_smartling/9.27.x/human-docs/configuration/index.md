# Configuration

Smartling is configured **per TMGMT provider**, not on a single module settings page.
Each provider is a `tmgmt.translator.<id>` config entity that holds one Smartling
project's credentials and options.

## Create a Smartling provider

1. Log in as a user with the **Administer Translation Management** permission.
2. Go to **Translation → Providers** (`/admin/tmgmt/translators`) and add a provider.
3. Choose **Smartling** as the translator plugin. The Smartling settings form appears.
4. Fill in the sections below, then save.

## Credentials & connection

- **Project Id**, **User Id**, **Token Secret** — your Smartling API credentials,
  used by the Smartling PHP SDK to authenticate. Store the **Token Secret** via a Key
  entity or a `settings.php` override if you would rather not keep it in exported
  configuration (see the installation guide).
- **The desired format for download** (default **XML**) — the export/import format
  (XML or XLIFF, provided by TMGMT File). An XLIFF-processing toggle controls XLIFF
  handling.
- **Scheme** (default `public`) and **Retrieval type** (default `published`) — where
  translation files are stored and which revision is retrieved.

## Callbacks — how finished translations come back

- **Use Smartling callback** (default off) — when on, the module registers a callback
  URL (`[host]/tmgmt-smartling-callback/[job_id]`) with Smartling, so a completed
  translation triggers a download automatically.
- **Override host value** — the base host used when building that callback URL, useful
  when your public host differs from Drupal's computed base URL.

> **Security note.** The callback routes are **public and unsigned** — Smartling
> calls them without a shared secret or signature; they validate only that the job
> exists and that the expected request parameters are present, then schedule a
> download. This is by design, but it is why the callback is off by default. If you do
> not need push-style delivery, leave it off and rely on cron/on-demand downloads
> instead.

## Context — visual screenshots for translators

Context uploads a rendered version of the page so translators see strings in place.

- **Username for context retrieval** — the account used to render the page for
  capture. Note that sending context "involves automatically switching user during
  upload", so treat the *Send context smartling* permission as trusted.
- **Context URL host** and **Skip host verification** (default off) — control the
  host used and whether it is verified.
- **Enable basic auth for context** (default off) plus **Login** / **Password** — use
  these when the site sits behind HTTP basic auth so the context renderer can fetch
  pages.
- **Exclude entity types from context** — opt specific entity types or bundles out of
  context capture.

## Content handling

- **Automatically authorize content** (default on) — authorize uploaded content for
  translation in Smartling without a manual step.
- **Custom placeholder (regexp)** (default `(@|%|!)[\w-]+`) — protects tokens such as
  `@name` or `%count` from being translated.
- **Translatable HTML attributes** (default `title, alt`) and **Exclude attributes** —
  which HTML attributes are sent for translation and which are skipped.
- **Segment strings by HTML tags** — force segmentation at specific tags.
- **Identical file names** (default off) — reuse identical file names across uploads.

## Delivery & operations

- **Asynchronous mode** (default off) — run uploads/downloads asynchronously through
  queues.
- **Download and apply translations per job item** (default off) — bring translations
  back one job item at a time rather than per whole job.
- **Enable Smartling remote logging** (default on) and **real-time notifications**
  (default on) — send logs/notifications to Smartling.
- The form also surfaces **cron & queue** status and actions. Uploads and downloads
  run through the TMGMT Extension Suite's scheduler and queue workers, so **cron must
  be running** for translation to progress.

## Save

Save the provider. You can then create TMGMT jobs and pick this Smartling provider as
their translator. There are no Drush commands specific to this module; if you script
provider changes, drive the `tmgmt.translator.<id>` config entity with
`drush config:set` / `drush config:import`.
