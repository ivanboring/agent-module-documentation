Phrase TMS Translator (`tmgmt_memsource`, formerly Memsource) is a TMGMT translator plugin that sends Drupal content — and optionally attached Office files — to the Phrase TMS (phrase.com) cloud for professional/machine translation and pulls the results back as XLIFF.

---

The module registers a TMGMT `TranslatorPlugin` with id `memsource`, so you create a *Provider* under TMGMT (`entity.tmgmt_translator.collection`) whose settings hold the Phrase TMS Home URL, user name and password, plus options for a preview connector, file translation, and cron pulling. On submission it authenticates to the Phrase TMS REST API (`/api2/v1/auth/login`, token cached in Drupal `state`), creates a project (optionally from a project template, optionally grouping several jobs into one project), exports each job item to XLIFF via `tmgmt_file`, uploads it as a Phrase "job part", and records a `tmgmt_remote` RemoteMapping (project uid + job part uid) per item. Completed translations return either by cron (`memsource.cron_task`, gated to an active hour window and a per-run item limit), by the manual *Pull translations* button, or by an inbound webhook at `/tmgmt_memsource_callback` that Phrase TMS calls on status change. The password is stored on the translator config with a reversible `MEMSOURCE_V2___` hex encoding (not encryption). When *Enable translation of file attachments* is on, matching attached files (per the TMGMT allowed MIME types) are uploaded alongside the XLIFF and the translated files are downloaded and saved with a language suffix (e.g. `document_de.docx`). Note the webhook callback route is unauthenticated (`_access: 'TRUE'`) — see `security.md`.

- Set a due date on a job that is forwarded to the Phrase project/job.
- Auto-accept incoming translations by enabling the translator's auto-accept option.
- Select a Phrase preview connector so translators can preview Drupal content in-context.
