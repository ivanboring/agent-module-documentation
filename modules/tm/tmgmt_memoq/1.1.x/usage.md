MemoQ translator is a TMGMT (Translation Management Tool) provider plugin that connects Drupal's translation jobs to a memoQ server's CMS API, sending source content as XLIFF and pulling completed translations back. It requires the `tmgmt` and `tmgmt_file` modules.

---

The module registers a single TMGMT translator plugin (`tmgmt_memoq`) whose settings — memoQ **CMS API URL**, **API key**, an order name prefix, per-language code mappings, and XLIFF processing/CDATA toggles — are stored on a TMGMT `translator` config entity (there is no standalone settings page; you add a "MemoQ" translator under `admin/tmgmt/translators`). On request (`requestTranslation`), it creates a memoQ **order**, exports each job item to gzipped XLIFF via the `tmgmt_file` "xlf" format, uploads it as a memoQ job, stores memoQ ids in TMGMT `RemoteMapping` entities, and commits the order; every outbound call goes to the configured `api_url` with an `Authorization: CMSGATEWAY-API <api_key>` header. Completed translations are retrieved two ways: a memoQ-initiated **callback** at `/tmgmt/memoqcallback/{tmgmt_job}` (`MemoQController`) that, on a `TranslationReady` status, looks up the remote mapping and imports the translated XLIFF; and a pull-style `fetchJobs()` that queries the order's jobs and imports any that are ready. The callback route is declared `_access: 'TRUE'` (no authentication/CSRF/signature). Two alter hooks (`hook_tmgmt_memoq_order_info_alter`, `hook_tmgmt_memoq_job_info_alter`) let other modules tweak the order/job payloads before submission. Extended XLIFF processing masks HTML tags rather than escaping them, and a CDATA option controls XLIFF import/export encoding.
