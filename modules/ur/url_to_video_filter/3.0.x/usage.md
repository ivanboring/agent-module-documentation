URL To Video Filter turns a bare YouTube or Vimeo URL pasted into body text into an embedded player — no CKEditor plugin, no media entity, just a text filter that recognises the URL and replaces it with a responsive embed.

---

The module is a single filter plugin, `filter_url_to_video` (*Convert URLs to embedded videos*), declared with the modern `#[Filter]` attribute. Its settings are per text format and start **off**: `youtube` and `vimeo` toggles decide which providers are recognised, and `youtube_webp_preview` opts into a WebP preview image rather than loading the player immediately — a lighter, privacy-friendlier default that only loads the third-party iframe when the visitor clicks. The settings summary reports each provider as On or Off so a site builder can see at a glance what a format does. Styling comes from a small library with a compiled `url_to_video_embed.css` (SCSS source and source map included) and a `no-js.png` fallback image for browsers without JavaScript. Because it is a text filter, editors simply paste a URL on its own and the rendered output contains the player; nothing changes in the stored content, so disabling the filter reverts to plain links.
