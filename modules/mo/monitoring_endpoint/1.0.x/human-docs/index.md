# Monitoring Endpoint — manual setup guide

**Monitoring Endpoint** (`monitoring_endpoint`) exposes a single JSON API
endpoint — **`/monitoring/status`** — that external monitoring tools can poll to
read the results of your site's [Monitoring](https://www.drupal.org/project/monitoring)
sensors (and, where present, Ultimate Cron job statuses). The response is a
machine-readable summary — a count of critical failures plus the status of each
enabled sensor — designed to drop straight into tools like Uptime Kuma, Nagios or
Icinga, or any custom script that can parse JSON.

The endpoint is meant to be reached without a Drupal login (a monitoring probe has
no session), so access is gated by a **token** passed as a query parameter:
`/monitoring/status?token=YOUR-TOKEN`, matched against a configured
`endpoint_key`. Each sensor reports a standard status — `OK`, `WARNING`,
`CRITICAL` or `INFO` — and results are uncached by default so monitors always see
real-time data.

This module needs one piece of configuration before it is safe to use: **you must
set a non-empty endpoint key immediately after enabling it.** By default the key
is empty, which — as explained below — leaves the endpoint readable by anyone. It
depends on the Monitoring module and requires PHP 8.1.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer and enable the
   module.
2. [Configuration](configuration/index.md) — set the endpoint key (do this
   straight away), point your monitor at the endpoint, and lock it down.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

The settings form is a simple configuration UI restricted to users with the
**Administer site configuration** permission (you can also configure the endpoint
directly in `settings.php`). Once configured, the JSON is served at
**`/monitoring/status?token=YOUR-TOKEN`**.

## Important: the default key is empty — set it before use

The `endpoint_key` ships as an **empty string**, and access is granted when the
supplied token equals the configured key. That means a request with an empty token
— `/monitoring/status?token=` — matches the empty default, so **the endpoint is
served anonymously until an administrator sets a non-empty key.** In that state the
site's monitoring and cron status (failure counts, sensor details) is publicly
readable, which is useful reconnaissance for an attacker.

So the first thing to do after enabling this module is set a strong, non-empty
endpoint key. Serve the endpoint only over **HTTPS** and treat the token as a
bearer secret. Full steps are in [Configuration](configuration/index.md).
