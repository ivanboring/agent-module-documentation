# DSFR Menus — manual setup guide

**DSFR Menus** (`dsfr_menu`) lets you build navigation menus that render with the
correct markup and styling of the DSFR — *Système de Design de l'État*, the
French State Design System. It generates standard DSFR‑styled menus and places
them **directly in your theme's assigned regions**, so a French government site
gets compliant navigation without hand‑building the DSFR menu markup. It also
works with DSFR child themes.

It builds on **DSFR Core** and uses Drupal's core menu machinery: it depends on
the core **Block**, **Menu Link (content)**, and **Text** modules, plus
**DSFR Core** (`dsfr_core`). Because it renders menus as blocks, you set it up the
same way you place any menu — by placing the DSFR menu block into the region where
you want the navigation to appear, using the menu whose links you manage in the
usual place.

The module provides its own permission(s); review them at **People → Permissions**
after enabling. There is no dedicated settings form — configuration is placing the
menu block(s) and managing menu links through Drupal's standard menu UI.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install the module with Composer and
   enable it (it requires DSFR Core).

There is **no dedicated configuration page**. You set menus up through Drupal's
standard **Menus** and **Block layout** screens, described below.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

DSFR Menus adds no settings page of its own. You work with it through the core
tools: manage menu links at **Structure → Menus** (`/admin/structure/menu`), and
place the DSFR‑styled menu block(s) at **Structure → Block layout**
(`/admin/structure/block`). Review its permissions at **People → Permissions**
(`/admin/people/permissions`).

## How to use it

1. Make sure the base **DSFR theme** is in use, so the DSFR menu markup is styled
   correctly.
2. Create or choose a menu and add its links at **Structure → Menus**
   (`/admin/structure/menu`).
3. Go to **Structure → Block layout** (`/admin/structure/block`) and place the
   DSFR menu block for that menu into the region where the navigation should
   appear.
4. Configure the block's visibility if needed, save, and view the site to confirm
   the menu renders with DSFR styling.
