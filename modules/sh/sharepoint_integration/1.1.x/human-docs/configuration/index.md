# Configuration

SharePoint Integration is set up on its own connection form. This is where you tell
Drupal how to reach your SharePoint / Azure app so the two systems can connect.

## Open the connection form

1. Log in as a user with the module's administer permission (an administrator by
   default — the module provides its own permissions, so review them at
   **People → Permissions** if you want to delegate access).
2. Go to the **SharePoint Integration** connection configuration form (route
   `sharepoint_integration.connection`), reached from the module's link in the
   site's Configuration area.

## Set up the connection

On the connection form you provide the details of your SharePoint / Azure app
registration — the client ID and secret (and related connection settings) that let
Drupal authenticate to SharePoint. Enter those values, save, and the module uses
them to establish the connection for integration, SSO, and content access.

Treat the client ID and secret as secrets: store them securely and make sure the
connection runs over HTTPS.

## A note on the in-module support form

This version of the module includes a miniOrange support / feedback form. Be aware
that the request it sends to miniOrange is made with TLS verification disabled. That
request carries your admin email, your site and PHP version, and a shared miniOrange
key — but **not** your SharePoint credentials or session, and it is separate from the
actual SharePoint connection (which uses a normal secure HTTP client). The risk is
low, but to be safe, avoid submitting the in-module support form while you are on an
untrusted network.
