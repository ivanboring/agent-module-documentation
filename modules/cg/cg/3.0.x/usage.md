Content Guide attaches per-field editorial guidance to entity forms: an editor sees documentation (rendered from a Markdown file) beside the widget it applies to, so authoring conventions live next to the fields instead of in a separate manual.

Guidance is enabled per widget via third-party settings on the form display (a `document_path` pointing at a Markdown file under a configured base directory). At runtime a JS behaviour requests `/content-guide/{langcode}`; the `ContentGuideController` reads the Markdown file, renders it with Parsedown, resolves internal links, runs `Xss::filterAdmin()`, and returns HTML. Requests must carry a valid CSRF token bound to the field identifier and the caller needs the `use content guide` permission. Language-specific variants of a document (`name.{langcode}.md`) are used when present. Event subscribers extend coverage to Paragraphs, Media and Entity-reference widgets, and the `cg_field_group` submodule integrates with Field Group.

Settings (base document path, etc.) are at `/admin/config/content/content_guide` under `administer content guide` (restricted); a file-autocomplete endpoint helps pick Markdown files. Note the document loader concatenates the request-supplied `X-CG-Document-Path` header onto the base path without a traversal check before `file_get_contents()`, so a holder of `use content guide` could read files outside the guide directory — review before granting that permission broadly.

Point a form widget at a Markdown guide file; editors then see rendered guidance inline while authoring.
