CKEditor Braille lets editors write Braille directly in CKEditor 5: letter combinations are mapped to Braille Unicode characters, and a toolbar toggle switches Braille input on and off. It also bundles a practice course/quiz and supports formatted text and math operations in Braille.

The module provides a CKEditor 5 plugin (added to a format's toolbar via a Braille icon), a text-format **filter** (`BraillePreview`) that renders Braille in output, and an **Exercise** page (`/ckeditor-braille/exercise`, `access content`) offering practice challenges. Letter-to-Braille mappings are configured in the text format's settings, so different formats can use different mappings. Setup: install CKEditor 5, create/edit a CKEditor 5 text format, drag the Braille button into the toolbar, and map letter combos to Braille Unicode values.

The Exercise route is a read-only practice page. There is no admin configuration beyond the per-format toolbar/filter/mapping settings; a dev workflow (`npm install`, `npm run watch`) is documented for building the JS.
