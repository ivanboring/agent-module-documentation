# CKEditor Mentions — manual setup guide

**CKEditor Mentions** (`ckeditor_mentions`) brings `@`‑mentions to CKEditor 5 —
the smart autocomplete familiar from Slack, Jira, or Facebook. Type `@` in the
editor and a list of matching users appears; pick one and the inserted mention
becomes a link to that user. Two optional submodules extend it: mention arbitrary
entities (not just users), and display real names instead of usernames.

The value is the same as in any collaboration tool: mentioning a person creates a
reference the system can act on, rather than just a name typed into prose. Beyond
linking, the module exposes an event system (`ckeditor_mentions.rules.events.yml`)
so a mention can trigger a workflow — for example, a notification — through Rules
or ECA. That event integration is often the real reason to install it, rather than
the linking alone.

The access design is worth understanding before you enable it. The autocomplete is
served by an AJAX callback, and that callback is gated by a dedicated permission,
**Use inline mentions**, whose purpose is precisely to protect that path. This
matters because a user‑matching endpoint is a **user‑enumeration surface** — it
answers "does a user matching this string exist" — so you should grant the
permission only to the roles that actually author content or comments, and **never
to anonymous users**.

Requirements are modest: PHP 8.1 or newer, core **CKEditor 5** and **Image**, and
the `masterminds/html5` library for parsing (Composer pulls it in). The active
line is **3.x**, which supports CKEditor 5 only; the current release is a **beta**
(3.0.0‑beta5), so factor that in for production.

This guide is written for a **human** clicking through the admin UI. If you want
terse, token‑cheap references for an AI coding agent, read the sibling
[`agent/`](../agent/start.md) docs instead.

## Contents

1. [Installation](installation/index.md) — install with Composer, enable the
   module and optional submodules, add the toolbar button per text format, and
   grant the mention permission.

There is **no standalone settings page** — you enable the feature per text format
and control access with the mention permission, both covered in Installation.

## Where it lives in the admin menu

Mentions is enabled per text format through the CKEditor 5 toolbar configuration at
**Configuration → Content authoring → Text formats and editors**
(`/admin/config/content/formats`). Access is controlled at **People →
Permissions** (`/admin/people/permissions`), where you grant the **Use inline
mentions** permission to the appropriate roles.

## How to use it

Once the feature is enabled on a format and a user has the mention permission, they
type `@` in a CKEditor 5 field, choose a match from the autocomplete list, and the
mention is inserted as a link. If you have installed the entity submodule they can
mention other entity types (such as taxonomy terms); with the realname submodule
the suggestions show real names rather than usernames. To act on mentions — say,
to email the mentioned user — wire the module's events to Rules or ECA.
