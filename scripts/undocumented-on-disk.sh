# List contrib modules that are already in web/modules/contrib but have no docs yet.
#
# Composer pulls dependencies, and dependencies are modules too - over 50 waves the site
# accumulated 50+ modules that were never on any wave list because nobody required them
# directly. They need no composer resolution (they are already on disk, already D11-resolvable,
# usually already enabled), so they are the cheapest documentation targets available and
# cannot fail to install. Wave 53 was built entirely from this pool.
#
# Matching mirrors next-wave.sh: a project is "documented" if a directory named after it OR
# after its main module machine name exists under modules/ (two-letter bucket) or as a nested
# submodule. That handles project->module renames (project `confi` ships module `config_import`).
#
# Usage (from the repo root, host or container):
#   scripts/undocumented-on-disk.sh              # names only
#   scripts/undocumented-on-disk.sh --verbose    # name, main module, core_version_requirement
