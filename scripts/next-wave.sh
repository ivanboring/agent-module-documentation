# Print the next N undocumented projects from the campaign list, in popularity order.
#
# "Undocumented" is recomputed from disk every call: a project is skipped if a directory
# modules/<first-2-letters>/<project>/ exists (two-letter bucket layout). This is
# self-correcting — as each wave lands new dirs, they drop out of the next pick
# automatically, so there is no cursor to keep in sync.
#
# It cannot see project→module renames (project private_files_download_permission ships
# module pfdp), so a handful of already-done projects may reappear; the installer and
# wave-prepare treat those as no-ops. Known-unresolvable projects are listed in
# scripts/.campaign-skip and filtered out here.
#
# Usage (from the repo root, host or container):
#   scripts/next-wave.sh [N]          (default 40)
# Prints one project machine name per line.
