# Return the site to the clean per-wave baseline: no contrib modules, fresh database.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# Waves 1-51 installed cumulatively. By wave 52 the root had 2,311 requirements and new
# modules could no longer resolve against it — wave 54 attempted 10 projects that all had a
# verified Drupal 11 release and installed **zero** of them, every failure a version clash
# with something an earlier wave had pinned (symfony_mailer_queue needs symfony_mailer
# ^1.4/^1.5 vs a pinned ^2.0; aos needs animate_on_scroll ^1|^2 vs a pinned ^3.0). The fix is
# to stop accumulating: install only what the wave needs, document it, then reset.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   1. composer.json require -> core + scaffolding only (the BASELINE list below)
#   2. composer update        -> deletes every contrib module from web/modules/contrib
#   3. database               -> restored from the `base-minimal` ddev snapshot, or
#                                reinstalled with drush site:install if --site-install
#
# RECOVERY
# The pre-reset composer.json/composer.lock of the original cumulative site are kept in
# .campaign-backups/. `cp .campaign-backups/composer.lock.pre-reset composer.lock &&
# composer install` puts all ~2,300 modules back.
#
# Usage (from the repo root, host):
#   scripts/wave-reset.sh                 # snapshot restore (fast, preferred)
#   scripts/wave-reset.sh --site-install   # drush site:install instead
#   scripts/wave-reset.sh --dry-run
